      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2011), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OBSOLETE PROVISIONS</HD>
        <P>Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>CMRS spectrum aggregation limit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Spectrum limitation.</E> No licensee in the broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR services (including all parties under common control) regulated as CMRS (<E T="03">see</E> 47 CFR 20.9) shall have an attributable interest in a total of more than 55 MHz of licensed broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum regulated as CMRS with significant overlap in any geographic area.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">SMR spectrum.</E> To calculate the amount of attributable SMR spectrum for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an entity must count all 800 MHz and 900 MHz channels located at any SMR base station inside the geographic area (MTA or BTA) where there is significant overlap. All 800 MHz channels located on at least one of those identified base stations count as 50 kHz (25 kHz paired), and all 900 MHz channels located on at least one of <PRTPAGE P="8"/>those identified base stations count as 25 kHz (12.5 kHz paired); provided that any discrete 800 or 900 MHz channel shall be counted only once per licensee within the geographic area, even if the licensee in question utilizes the same channel at more than one location within the relevant geographic area. No more than 10 MHz of SMR spectrum in the 800 and 900 MHz SMR services will be attributed to an entity when determining compliance with the cap.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Significant overlap.</E> (1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, significant overlap of a PCS licensed service area and CGSA(s) (as defined in § 22.911 of this chapter) or SMR service area(s) occurs when at least 10 percent of the population of the PCS licensed service area for the counties contained therein, as determined by the latest available decennial census figures as complied by the Bureau of the Census, is within the CGSA(s) and/or SMR service area(s).</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission shall presume that an SMR service area covers less than 10 percent of the population of a PCS service area if none of the base stations of the SMR licensee are located within the PCS service area. For an SMR licensee's base stations that are located within a PCS service area, the channels licensed at those sites will be presumed to cover 10 percent of the population of the PCS service area, unless the licensee shows that its protected service contour for all of its base stations covers less than 10 percent of the population of the PCS service area.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Ownership attribution.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ownership and other interests in broadband PCS licensees, cellular licensees, or SMR licensees will be attributed to their holders pursuant to the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest means majority voting equity ownership, any general partnership interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative control) over the operation of the licensee, in whatever manner exercised.</P>
            <P>(2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee shall be attributed, except that ownership will not be attributed unless the partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest amount to at least 40 percent of the equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee if the ownership interest is held by a small business or a rural telephone company, as these terms are defined in § 1.2110 of this chapter or other related provisions of the Commission's rules, or if the ownership interest is held by an entity with a non-controlling equity interest in a broadband PCS licensee or applicant that is a small business.</P>
            <P>(3) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in trust accounts will be considered to have an attributable interest only if they hold 40 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee, or if any of the officers or directors of the broadband PCS, cellular or SMR licensee are representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if under common management.</P>
            <P>(4) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, options, or other interests (except non-voting stock) with rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until converted, except that this provision does not apply in determining whether an entity is a small business, a rural telephone company, or a business owned by minorities and/or women, as these terms are defined in § 1.2110 of this chapter or other related provisions of the Commission's rules.</P>

            <P>(6) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited partners <PRTPAGE P="9"/>and shall be calculated according to both the percentage of equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses.</P>
            <P>(7) Officers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee shall be considered to have an attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. The officers and directors of an entity that controls a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, a cellular licensee, or an SMR licensee shall be considered to have an attributable interest in the broadband PCS licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee.</P>
            <P>(8) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. (For example, if A owns 20% of B, and B owns 40% of licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C would be 8%. If A owns 20% of B, and B owns 51% of licensee C, then A's interest in licensee C would be 20% because B's ownership of C exceeds 50%.)</P>
            <P>(9) Any person who manages the operations of a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee pursuant to a management agreement shall be considered to have an attributable interest in such licensee if such person, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence,</P>
            <P>(i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;</P>
            <P>(ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The prices charged for such services.</P>
            <P>(10) Any licensee or its affiliate who enters into a joint marketing arrangements with a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee, or its affiliate shall be considered to have an attributable interest, if such licensee, or its affiliate, has authority to make decisions or otherwise engage in practices or activities that determine, or significantly influence,</P>
            <P>(i) The nature or types of services offered by such licensee;</P>
            <P>(ii) The terms upon which such services are offered; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The prices charged for such services.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Divestiture.</E> (1) Divestiture of interests as a result of a transfer of control or assignment of authorization must occur prior to consummating the transfer or assignment, except that a licensee that meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall have 90 days from final grant to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation limit.</P>
            <P>(2) An applicant with:</P>
            <P>(i) Controlling or attributable ownership interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses where the geographic license areas cover 20 percent or less of the applicant's service area population;</P>
            <P>(ii) Attributable interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses solely due to management agreements or joint marketing agreements; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Non-controlling attributable interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licenses, regardless of the degree to which the geographic license areas cover the applicant's service area population, shall be eligible to have its application granted subject to a condition that the licensee shall come into compliance with the spectrum limitation set out in paragraph (a) within ninety (90) days after final grant. For purposes of this paragraph, a “non-controlling attributable interest” is one in which the holder has less than a fifty (50) percent voting interest and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a fifty (50) percent or greater voting interest.</P>

            <P>(3) The applicant for a license that, if granted, would exceed the spectrum aggregation limitation in paragraph (a) of this section shall certify on its application that it and all parties to the application will come into compliance with this limitation. If such an applicant is a successful bidder in an auction, it must submit with its long-form <PRTPAGE P="10"/>application a signed statement describing its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation limitation. A similar statement must also be included with any application for assignment of licenses or transfer of control that, if granted, would exceed the spectrum aggregation limit.</P>

            <P>(4)(i) Parties holding controlling interests in broadband PCS, cellular, and/or SMR licensees that conflict with the attribution threshold or geographic overlap limitations set forth in this section will be considered to have come into compliance if they have submitted to the Commission an application for assignment of license or transfer of control of the conflicting licensee (<E T="03">see</E> § 1.948 of this chapter; <E T="03">see also</E> § 24.839 of this chapter (PCS)) by which, if granted, such parties no longer would have an attributable interest in the conflicting license. Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not been secured in the required period of time, as long as the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the trustee may dispose of the license as it sees fit. Where parties to broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR applications hold less than controlling (but still attributable) interests in broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee(s), they shall submit a certification that the applicant and all parties to the application have come into compliance with the limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Applicants that meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section must tender to the Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial license, such an assignment or transfer application or, in the case of less than controlling (but still attributable) interests, a written certification that the applicant and all parties to the application have come into compliance with the limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section. If no such transfer or assignment application or certification is tendered to the Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant of the initial license, the Commission may consider the certification and the divestiture statement to be material, bad faith misrepresentations and shall invoke the condition on the initial license or the assignment or transfer, cancelling or rescinding it automatically, shall retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, based on the facts presented, shall take any other action it may deem appropriate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>State petitions for authority to regulate rates.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) States may petition for authority to regulate the intrastate rates of any <PRTPAGE P="15"/>commercial mobile radio service. The petition must include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for commercial mobile radio services do not adequately protect subscribers to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market conditions for commercial mobile radio services do not protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial portion of the commercial mobile radio service subscribers in the state or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining basic telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range of basic telephone service alternatives available to consumers in the state.</P>
            <P>(2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of evidence, information, and analysis that may be considered pertinent to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission in reviewing any petition filed by a state under this section:</P>
            <P>(i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the state, the types of services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have offered service in the state;</P>
            <P>(ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service provider in the state; trends in each provider's customer base during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of return for each commercial mobile radio service provider;</P>
            <P>(iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service provider, including trends in each provider's rates during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data is unavailable;</P>
            <P>(iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the commercial mobile radio service providers the state proposes to regulate are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;</P>
            <P>(v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of competing services, and an analysis of any barriers to such entry;</P>
            <P>(vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive or discriminatory practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in the state;</P>
            <P>(vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with particularity instances of systematic unjust and unreasonable rates, or rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon commercial mobile radio service subscribers. Such evidence should include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. Additionally, evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace in the state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be considered especially probative; and</P>
            <P>(viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers, including statistics and other information about complaints filed with the state regulatory commission.</P>
            <P>(3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency filing the petition is the duly authorized state agency responsible for the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.</P>
            <P>(4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.</P>

            <P>(5) States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file comments in support or in opposition to the petition within 30 days after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this section. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 days after the expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings may be filed. Except for § 1.45 of this chapter, practice and procedure rules contained in §§ 1.42-1.52 of this chapter <PRTPAGE P="16"/>shall apply. The provisions of §§ 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.</P>
            <P>(6) The Commission shall act upon any petition filed by a state under this paragraph not later than the end of the nine-month period after the filing of the petition.</P>
            <P>(7) If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio services in the state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the Commission. The period of time specified by the Commission will be that necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</P>
            <P>(b) States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under this section before August 10, 1994, to extend this authority.</P>
            <P>(1) The petition will be acted upon by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission shall act upon the petition (including any reconsideration) not later than the end of the 12-month period following the date of the filing of the petition by the state involved. Commercial mobile radio service providers offering such service in the state shall comply with the existing regulations of the state until the petition and any reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(c) No sooner than 18 months from grant of authority by the Commission under this section for state rate regulations, any interested party may petition the Commission for an order to discontinue state authority for rate regulation.</P>
            <P>(1) Petitions to discontinue state authority for rate regulation must be based on recent empirical data or other significant evidence demonstrating that the exercise of rate authority by a state is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile are just and reasonable or not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</P>
            <P>(2) Any interested party may file comments in support of or in opposition to the petition within 30 days after public notice of the filing of the petition. Any interested party may file a reply within 15 days after the time for filing comments has expired. No additional pleadings may be filed. Except for 1.45 of this chapter, practice and procedure rules contained in § 1.42-1.52 of this chapter apply. The provisions of §§ 1.771-1.773 of this chapter do not apply.</P>

Upon filing and service of such certification, the carrier may suspend further implementation efforts, except as provided in paragraph (j)(4)(x) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) As a prerequisite to filing such certification, no later than 21 days prior to such filing, the wireless carrier must notify the affected PSAP, in writing, of its intent to file such certification. Any response that the carrier receives from the PSAP must be included with the carrier's certification filing.</P>
            <P>(ii) The certification process shall be subject to the procedural requirements set forth in sections 1.45 and 1.47 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(iii) The certification must be in the form of an affidavit signed by a director or officer of the carrier, documenting:</P>
            <P>(A) The basis for the carrier's determination that the PSAP will not be ready;</P>
            <P>(B) Each of the specific steps the carrier has taken to provide the E911 service requested;</P>
            <P>(C) The reasons why further implementation efforts cannot be made until the PSAP becomes capable of receiving and utilizing the data elements associated with the E911 service requested; and</P>
            <P>(D) The specific steps that remain to be completed by the wireless carrier and, to the extent known, the PSAP or other parties before the carrier can provide the E911 service requested.</P>
            <P>(iv) All affidavits must be correct. The carrier must ensure that its affidavit is correct, and the certifying director or officer has the duty to personally determine that the affidavit is correct.</P>
            <P>(v) A carrier may not engage in a practice of filing inadequate or incomplete certifications for the purpose of delaying its responsibilities.</P>
            <P>(vi) To be eligible to make a certification, the wireless carrier must have completed all necessary steps toward E911 implementation that are not dependent on PSAP readiness.</P>

            <P>(vii) A copy of the certification must be served on the PSAP in accordance with § 1.47 of this chapter. The PSAP may challenge in writing the accuracy of the carrier's certification and shall serve a copy of such challenge on the carrier. <E T="03">See</E> §§ 1.45 and 1.47 and §§ 1.720 through 1.736 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(viii) If a wireless carrier's certification is facially inadequate, the six-month implementation period specified <PRTPAGE P="22"/>in paragraphs (d), (f) and (g) of this section will not be suspended as provided for in paragraph (j)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ix) If a wireless carrier's certification is inaccurate, the wireless carrier will be liable for noncompliance as if the certification had not been filed.</P>
            <P>(x) A carrier that files a certification under paragraph (j)(4) of this section shall have 90 days from receipt of the PSAP's written notice that it is capable of receiving and utilizing the data elements associated with the service requested to provide such service in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Modification of deadlines by agreement.</E> Nothing in this section shall prevent Public Safety Answering Points and carriers from establishing, by mutual consent, deadlines different from those imposed for carrier and PSAP compliance in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Dispatch service.</E> A service provider covered by this section who offers dispatch service to customers may meet the requirements of this section with respect to customers who utilize dispatch service either by complying with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, or by routing the customer's emergency calls through a dispatcher. If the service provider chooses the latter alternative, it must make every reasonable effort to explicitly notify its current and potential dispatch customers and their users that they are not able to directly reach a PSAP by calling 911 and that, in the event of an emergency, the dispatcher should be contacted.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Non-service-initialized handsets.</E> (1) Licensees subject to this section that donate a non-service-initialized handset for purposes of providing access to 911 services are required to:</P>

                  <P>(a) Scope of section; definitions. (1) The hearing aid compatibility requirements of this section apply to providers of digital CMRS in the United States to the extent that they offer real-time, two-way switched voice or data service that is interconnected with the public switched network and utilizes an in-network switching facility that enables the provider to reuse frequencies and accomplish seamless hand-offs of subscriber calls, and such service is provided over frequencies in the 800-950 MHz or 1.6-2.5 GHz bands using any air interface for which technical standards are stated in the standard document “American National Standard Methods of Measurement of Compatibility Between Wireless Communication Devices and Hearing Aids,” American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007).</P>
                  <P>(2) The requirements of this section also apply to the manufacturers of the wireless handsets that are used in delivery of the services specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Definitions</E>. For purposes of this section:</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Handset</E> refers to a device used in delivery of the services specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that contains a built-in speaker and is typically held to the ear in any of its ordinary uses.</P>
                  <P>(ii) <E T="03">Manufacturer</E> refers to a wireless handset manufacturer to which the requirements of this section apply.</P>
                  <P>(iii) <E T="03">Model</E> refers to a wireless handset device that a manufacturer has designated as a distinct device model, consistent with its own marketing practices. However, if a manufacturer assigns different model device designations solely to distinguish units sold to different carriers, or to signify other distinctions that do not relate to either form, features, or capabilities, such designations shall not count as distinct models for purposes of this section.</P>
                  <P>(iv) <E T="03">Service provider</E> refers to a provider of digital CMRS to which the requirements of this section apply.</P>
                  <P>(v) <E T="03">Tier I carrier</E> refers to a CMRS provider that offers such service nationwide.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Hearing aid compatibility; technical standards.</E> A wireless handset used for digital CMRS only over the frequency bands and air interfaces referenced in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is hearing aid-compatible with regard to radio <PRTPAGE P="24"/>frequency interference or inductive coupling if it meets the applicable technical standard(s) set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for all frequency bands and air interfaces over which it operates, and the handset has been certified as compliant with the test requirements for the applicable standard pursuant to § 2.1033(d) of this chapter. A wireless handset that incorporates an air interface or operates over a frequency band for which no technical standards are stated in ANSI C63.19-2007 (June 8, 2007) is hearing aid-compatible if the handset otherwise satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 20.20</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Conditions applicable to provision of CMRS service by incumbent Local Exchange Carriers.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Separate affiliate.</E> An incumbent LEC providing in-region broadband CMRS shall provide such services through an affiliate that satisfies the following requirements:</P>
                  <P>(1) The affiliate shall maintain separate books of account from its affiliated incumbent LEC. Nothing in this section requires the affiliate to maintain separate books of account that comply with part 32 of this chapter;</P>
                  <P>(2) The affiliate shall not jointly own transmission or switching facilities with its affiliated incumbent LEC that the affiliated incumbent LEC uses for the provision of local exchange service in the same in-region market. Nothing in this section prohibits the affiliate from sharing personnel or other resources or assets with its affiliated incumbent LEC; and</P>
                  <P>(3) The affiliate shall acquire any services from its affiliated incumbent LEC for which the affiliated incumbent LEC is required to file a tariff at tariffed rates, terms, and conditions. Other transactions between the affiliate and the incumbent LEC for services that are not acquired pursuant to tariff must be reduced to writing and must be made on a compensatory, arm's length basis. All transactions between the incumbent LEC and the affiliate are subject to part 32 of this chapter, including the affiliate transaction rules. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the affiliate from acquiring any unbundled network elements or exchange services for the provision of a telecommunications service from its affiliated incumbent LEC, subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in an agreement approved under section 252 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Independence.</E> The affiliate required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be a separate legal entity from its affiliated incumbent LEC. The affiliate may be staffed by personnel of its affiliated incumbent LEC, housed in existing offices of its affiliated incumbent LEC, and use its affiliated incumbent LEC's marketing and other services, subject to paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Joint marketing.</E> Joint marketing of local exchange and exchange access service and CMRS services by an incumbent LEC shall be subject to part 32 of this chapter. In addition, such agreements between the affiliate and the incumbent LEC must be reduced to writing and made available for public inspection upon request at the principle place of business of the affiliate and the incumbent LEC. The documentation must include a certification statement identical to the certification statement currently required to be included with all Automated Reporting and Management Information Systems (ARMIS) reports. The affiliate must also provide a detailed written description of the terms and conditions of the transaction on the Internet within 10 days of the transaction through the affiliate's home page.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rural telephone companies.</E> Rural telephone companies are exempted from the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section. A competing telecommunications carrier, interconnected with the rural telephone company, however, may petition the FCC to remove the exemption, or the FCC may do so on its own motion, where the rural telephone company has engaged in anticompetitive conduct.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Incumbent LECs with fewer than 2 percent of subscriber lines.</E> Incumbent LECs with fewer than 2 percent of the nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide may petition the FCC for suspension or modification of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section. The FCC will grant such a petition where the incumbent LEC demonstrates that suspension or modification of the separate affiliate requirement is<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(i) Necessary to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally or to avoid a requirement that would be unduly economically burdensome, and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> Terms used in this section have the following meanings:</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Affiliate.</E> “Affiliate” means a person that (directly or indirectly) owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership with, another person. For purposes of this section, the term “own” means to own an equity interest (or the equivalent thereof) of more than 10 percent.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Broadband Commercial Mobile Radio Service (Broadband CMRS).</E> For the purposes of this section, “broadband CMRS” means Cellular Radiotelephone Service (part 22, subpart H of this chapter), Specialized Mobile Radio (part 90, subpart S of this chapter), and broadband Personal Communications Services (part 24, subpart E of this chapter).</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (Incumbent LEC).</E> “Incumbent LEC” has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 51.5 of this chapter.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">In-region.</E> For the purposes of this section, an incumbent LEC's broadband CMRS service is considered “in-region” when 10 percent or more of the population covered by the CMRS affiliate's authorized service area, as determined by the 1990 census figures, is within the affiliated incumbent LEC's wireline service area.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Rural Telephone Company.</E> “Rural Telephone Company” has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 51.5 of this chapter.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Procedures for mutually exclusive applications.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant of one application would effectively preclude the grant of one or more of the others under Commission rules governing the Public Mobile Services involved. The Commission uses the general procedures in this section for processing mutually exclusive applications in the Public Mobile Services. Additional specific procedures are prescribed in the subparts of this part governing the individual Public Mobile Services (see §§ 22.509, 22.717, and 22.949) and in part 1 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Separate applications.</E> Any applicant that files an application knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications should not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves, render the application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels or facilities should be filed in a separate application.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Filing groups.</E> Pending mutually exclusive applications are processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as defective (pursuant to § 1.945 of this chapter) any mutually exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range for inclusion in the filing group. The types of filing groups used in day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A filing group is one of the following types:</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Renewal filing group.</E> A renewal filing group comprises a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed mutually exclusive competing applications (<E T="03">see</E> § 1.935 of this chapter).</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Same-day filing group.</E> A same-day filing group comprises all mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which is normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s).</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group.</E> A 30-day notice and cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the filing dates) as acceptable for filing.</P>
                        <P>(4) <E T="03">Window filing group.</E> A window filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and including two specific dates, which are the first and last dates on which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be accepted for filing. In the case of a one-day window, the two dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> Generally, the Commission may grant one application in a <PRTPAGE P="41"/>filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the other application(s) in the filing that are excluded by that grant, pursuant to § 1.945 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Selection methods.</E> In selecting the application to grant, the Commission will use competitive bidding.</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Dismissal of applications.</E> The Commission may dismiss any application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to dismissal under § 1.945 of this chapter, either before or after employing selection procedures.</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Type of filing group used.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this part, the type of filing group used in the processing of two or more mutually exclusive applications depends upon the purpose(s) of the applications.</P>
                        <P>(i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization, a renewal filing group is used.</P>
                        <P>(ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification and none of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day filing group is used.</P>
                        <P>(iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the earliest filing date are applications for initial authorization, a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group is used, except that, for Phase I unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, a one-day window filing group is used (see § 22.949).</P>
                        <P>(4) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> If there is only one application in any type of filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing group. If there is more than one mutually exclusive application in a filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:</P>
                        <P>(i) <E T="03">Applications in a renewal filing group.</E> All mutually exclusive applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative consideration in a hearing.</P>
                        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.</E> (A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group are applications for initial authorization, the FCC administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with §§ 22.201 through 22.227 and subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter, as applicable. After such procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other applications may be dismissed without prejudice.</P>
                        <P>(B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group is an application for modification, the Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.</P>
                        <P>(iii) <E T="03">Applications in a same-day filing group.</E> If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes of all of the applications in the filing group.</P>
                        <P>(iv) <E T="03">Applications in a window filing group.</E> Applications in a window filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Terminology.</E> For the purposes of this section, terms have the following meanings:</P>

                        <P>For operations on certain channels in the Public Mobile Services, carriers must attempt to coordinate the proposed use of spectrum with other spectrum users prior to filing an application for authority to operate a station. Rules requiring this procedure for specific channels and types of stations are contained in the subparts governing the individual Public Mobile Services.</P>
                        <P>(a) Coordination comprises two steps—notification and response. Each step may be accomplished orally or in writing.</P>
                        <P>(b) Notification must include relevant technical details of the proposal. At minimum, this should include the following:</P>
                        <P>(1) Geographical coordinates of the antenna site(s).</P>
                        <P>(2) Transmitting and receiving channels to be added or changed.</P>
                        <P>(3) Transmitting power, emission type and polarization.</P>
                        <P>(4) Transmitting antenna pattern and maximum gain.</P>
                        <P>(5) Transmitting antenna height above ground level.</P>
                        <P>(c) Applicants and licensees receiving notification must respond promptly, even if no channel usage conflicts are anticipated. If any notified party fails to respond within 30 days, the applicant may file the application without a response from that party.</P>
                        <P>(d) The 30-day period begins on the date the notification is submitted to the Commission via the ULS. If the notification is by mail, this date may be ascertained by:</P>
                        <P>(1) The return receipt on certified mail,</P>
                        <P>(2) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the party being notified, or</P>
                        <P>(3) A reasonable estimate of the time required for the mail to reach its destination. In this case, the date when the 30-day period will expire must be stated in the notification.</P>
                        <P>(e) All channel usage conflicts discovered during the coordination process should be resolved prior to filing of the application. If the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve a particular conflict, the application may be accepted for filing if it contains a statement describing the unresolved conflict and a brief explanation of the reasons why a resolution was not achieved.</P>
                        <P>(f) If a number of changes in the technical parameters of a proposed facility become necessary during the course of the coordination process, an attempt should be made to minimize the number of separate notifications. If the changes are incorporated into a completely revised notice, the items that were changed from the previous notice should be identified.</P>
                        <P>(g) In situations where subsequent changes are not numerous or complex, the party receiving the changed notification should make an effort to respond in less than 30 days. If the applicant believes a shorter response time is reasonable and appropriate, it should so indicate in the notice and suggest a response date.</P>
                        <P>(h) If a subsequent change in the technical parameters of a proposed facility could not affect the facilities of one or more of the parties that received an initial notification, the applicant is not required to coordinate that change with these parties. However, these parties must be advised of the change and of the opinion that coordination is not required.</P>

                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Paging and Radiotelephone Service</E>. The provisions in this paragraph apply for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.</P>
                        <P>(1) The interfering contours of the additional transmitter(s) must be totally encompassed by the composite interfering contour of the existing station (or stations under common control of the applicant) on the same channel, except that this limitation does not apply to nationwide network paging stations or in-building radiation systems.</P>
                        <P>(2) Additional transmitters in the 43 MHz frequency range operate under developmental authority, subject to the conditions set forth in § 22.411.</P>
                        <P>(3) The additional transmitters must not operate on control channels in the 72-76 MHz, 470-512 MHz, 928 MHz, 932 MHz, 941 MHz or 959 MHz frequency ranges.</P>
                        <P>(e) <E T="03">Cellular radiotelephone service.</E> During the five-year build-out period, the service area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as calculated by the method set forth in § 22.911(a), must remain within the market, except that the service area boundaries may extend beyond the market boundary into the area that is part of the CGSA or is already encompassed by the service area boundaries of previously authorized facilities. After the five-year build-out period, the service area boundaries of the additional transmitters, as calculated by the method set forth in § 22.911(a), must remain within the CGSA. Licensees must notify the Commission (FCC Form 601) of any transmitters added under this section that cause a change in the CGSA boundary. The notification must include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as described in § 22.953(a)(1) through (3). If the addition of transmitters involves a contract service area boundary (SAB) extension (<E T="03">see</E> § 22.912), the notification must include a statement as to whether the five-year build-out period for the system on the relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed and whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in the market. The notification must be made electronically via the ULS, or delivered to the filing place (<E T="03">see</E> § 1.913 of this chapter) once yearly during the five-year build-out on the anniversary of the license grant date.</P>
                        <P>(f) <E T="03">Air-ground Radiotelephone Service.</E> Ground stations may be added to Commercial Aviation air-ground systems at previously established ground station locations, pursuant to § 22.859, subject to compliance with the applicable technical rules. This section does not apply to General Aviation air-ground stations.</P>
                        <P>(g) <E T="03">Rural Radiotelephone Service.</E> A “service area” and “interfering contours” must be determined using the same method as for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service. The service area and interfering contours so determined for the additional transmitter(s) must be totally encompassed by the similarly determined composite service area contour and predicted interfering contour, respectively, of the existing station on the same channel. This section does not apply to Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Systems.</P>
                        <P>(h) <E T="03">Offshore Radiotelephone Service.</E> This section does not apply to stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service.</P>

                        <P>The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions in the Public Mobile Services, except for the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service (see § 22.861, instead) and the Cellular Radiotelephone Service (see § 22.917, instead).</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Out of band emissions.</E> The power of any emission outside of the authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Measurement procedure.</E> Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 30 kHz or more. In the 60 kHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the authorized frequency range or channel, a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (i.e., 30 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</P>

In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.<PRTPAGE P="53"/>

                      <P>Eligible entities (<E T="03">see</E> § 22.7) may apply for, and the FCC may grant, authority to construct and operate one or more transmitters subject to the rules in this subpart and other limitations, waivers and/or conditions that may be prescribed. Authorizations granted on this basis are developmental authorizations. In general, the FCC grants developmental authorizations in situations and circumstances where it cannot reasonably be determined in advance whether a particular transmitter can be operated or a particular service can be provided without causing interference to the service of existing stations. For example, the FCC may grant developmental authorizations for:</P>
                      <P>(a) Field strength surveys to evaluate the technical suitability of antenna locations for stations in the Public Mobile Services;</P>
                      <P>(b) Experimentation leading to the potential development of a new Public Mobile Service or technology; or,</P>
                      <P>(c) Stations transmitting on channels in certain frequency ranges, to provide a trial period during which it can be individually determined whether such stations can operate without causing excessive interference to existing services.</P>

                      <P>Because of the potential for interference with the reception by broadcast television sets and video recorders of full service TV stations transmitting on TV Channels 4 and 5, 72-76 MHz channels are assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the antenna of any full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 only under developmental authorizations subject to the requirements of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Carrier responsibility.</E> Carriers so authorized shall operate the 72-76 MHz fixed station under developmental authority for a period of at least six months. During the developmental period, carriers must resolve any broadcast television receiver interference problems that may occur as a result of operation of the 72-76 MHz transmitter(s).</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 72-76 MHz fixed station under the following circumstances:</P>
                      <P>(1) After six months of operation under developmental authorization, and provided that broadcast TV interference complaints have been resolved by the carrier in a satisfactory manner. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization for a 72-76 MHz fixed station and wish to request a regular authorization must file an application using FCC Form 601 via the ULS prior to the expiration of the developmental authorization.</P>
                      <P>(2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a regular authorization of a 72-76 MHz fixed station in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, the FCC may grant such assignment or consent to such transfer of control provided that the station has been in continuous operation providing service with no substantial interruptions.</P>
                      <P>(3) If a proposed 72-76 MHz fixed transmitter antenna is to be located within 50 meters (164 feet) of the antenna of the full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, the FCC may grant a regular authorization instead of a developmental authorization.</P>

                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Availability.</E> The FCC may determine whether to issue a paging geographic area authorization for any specific channel or channel pair in any specific paging geographic area. The FCC may replace existing site specific authorizations for facilities on a channel or channel pair located in a paging geographic area with a paging geographic area authorization for that channel or channel pair, if in its sole discretion, the FCC determines that the public interest would be served by such replacement.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Filing windows.</E> The FCC accepts applications for paging geographic area authorizations only during filing windows. The FCC issues Public Notices announcing in advance the dates of the filing windows, and the specific paging geographic areas and channels for which applications may be accepted.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">One grant per geographic area.</E> The FCC may grant one and only one application for a paging geographic area authorization for any specific channel or channel pair in any specific paging geographic area defined in paragraph (b) of this section. Selection from among mutually exclusive applications for a paging geographic area authorization will be made in accordance with the procedures in §§ 22.131 and 22.200 through 22.299. If after the selection process but prior to filing a “long form” application, a successful bidder decides to partition the paging geographic area, the FCC may require and accept multiple “long form” applications from the consortium members.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Exclusive right to expand.</E> During the term of a paging geographic area authorization, the FCC does not accept, from anyone other than the paging geographic area licensee, any major application for authorization to operate a facility that would serve unserved area within the paging geographic area specified in that paging geographic area authorization, on the channel specified in that paging geographic area authorization, unless any extension of the interfering contour of the proposed facility falls:</P>
                      <P>(1) Within the composite interfering contour of another licensee; or,</P>
                      <P>(2) Into unserved area and the paging geographic area licensee consents to such extension.</P>
                      <P>(g) <E T="03">Subsequent applications not accepted.</E> During the term of a paging geographic area authorization, the FCC does not accept any application for authorization relating to a facility that is or would be located within the paging geographic area specified in that <PRTPAGE P="58"/>paging geographic area authorization, on the channel specified in that paging geographic area authorization, except in the following situations:</P>

                      <P>(1) FCC grant of an application authorizing the construction of the facility could have a significant environmental effect as defined by § 1.1307 of this chapter. <E T="03">See</E> § 22.115(a)(5).</P>

                      <P>(2) Specific international coordination procedures are required, prior to assignment of a channel to the facility, pursuant to a treaty or other agreement between the United States government and the government of Canada or Mexico. <E T="03">See</E> § 22.169.</P>
                      <P>(3) The paging geographic area licensee or another licensee of a system within the paging geographic area applies to assign its authorization or for FCC consent to a transfer of control.</P>
                      <P>(h) <E T="03">Adjacent geographic area coordination required.</E> Before constructing a facility for which the interfering contour (as defined in § 22.537 or § 22.567 of this part, as appropriate for the channel involved) would extend into another paging geographic area, a paging geographic area licensee must obtain the consent of the relevant co-channel paging geographic area licensee, if any, into whose area the interfering contour would extend. Licensees are expected to cooperate fully and in good faith attempt to resolve potential interference problems before bringing matters to the FCC. In the event that there is no co-channel paging geographic area licensee from whom to obtain consent in the area into which the interfering contour would extend, the facility may be constructed and operated subject to the condition that, at such time as the FCC issues a paging geographic area authorization for that adjacent geographic area, either consent must be obtained or the facility modified or eliminated such that the interfering contour no longer extends into the adjacent geographic area.</P>
                      <P>(i) <E T="03">Protection of existing service.</E> All facilities constructed and operated pursuant to a paging geographic area authorization must provide co-channel interference protection in accordance with § 22.537 or § 22.567, as appropriate for the channel involved, to all authorized co-channel facilities of exclusive licensees within the paging geographic area. Non-exclusive licensees on the thirty-five exclusive 929 MHz channels are not entitled to exclusive status, and will continue to operate under the sharing arrangements established with the exclusive licensees and other non-exclusive licensees that were in effect prior to February 19, 1997. MEA, EA, and nationwide geographic area licensees have the right to share with non-exclusive licensees on the thirty-five exclusive 929 MHz channels on a non-interfering basis.</P>
                      <P>(j) <E T="03">Site location restriction.</E> The transmitting antenna of each facility constructed and operated pursuant to a paging geographic area authorization must be located within the paging geographic area specified in the authorization.</P>
                      <P>(k) <E T="03">Coverage requirements.</E> Failure by an MEA or EA licensee to meet either the coverage requirements in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, or alternatively, the substantial service requirement in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, will result in automatic termination of authorizations for those facilities that were not authorized, constructed, and operating at the time the geographic area authorization was granted. MEA and EA licensees have the burden of showing when their facilities were authorized, constructed, and operating, and should retain necessary records of these sites until coverage requirements are fulfilled. For the purpose of this paragraph, to “cover” area means to include geographic area within the composite of the service contour(s) determined by the methods of §§ 22.537 or 22.567 as appropriate for the particular channel involved. Licensees may determine the population of geographic areas included within their service contours using either the 1990 census or the 2000 census, but not both.</P>

                      <P>(1) No later than three years after the initial grant of an MEA or EA geographic area authorization, the licensee must construct or otherwise acquire and operate sufficient facilities to cover one third of the population in the paging geographic area. The licensee must notify the FCC at the end of the three-year period pursuant to § 1.946 of this chapter, either that it has satisfied this requirement or that it <PRTPAGE P="59"/>plans to satisfy the alternative requirement to provide substantial service in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(2) No later than five years after the initial grant of an MEA or EA geographic area authorization, the licensee must construct or otherwise acquire and operate sufficient facilities to cover two thirds of the population in the paging geographic area. The licensee must notify the FCC at the end of the five year period pursuant to § 1.946 of this chapter, either that it has satisfied this requirement or that it has satisfied the alternative requirement to provide substantial service in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(3) As an alternative to the coverage requirements of paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, the paging geographic area licensee may demonstrate that, no later than five years after the initial grant of its paging geographic area authorization, it provides substantial service to the paging geographic area. “Substantial service” means service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Number of transmitters per station.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>This section concerns the number of transmitters licensed under each station authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, other than paging geographic area authorizations.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Operationally related transmitters.</E> Each station must have at least one transmitter. There is no limit to the number of transmitters that a station may comprise. However, transmitters within a station should be operationally related and/or should serve the same general geographical area. Operationally related transmitters are those that operate together as a system (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, trunked systems, simulcast systems), rather than independently.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Split of large systems.</E> The FCC may split wide-area systems into two or more stations for administrative convenience. Except for nationwide paging and other operationally related transmitters, transmitters that are widely separated geographically are not licensed under a single authorization.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Consolidation of separate stations.</E> The FCC may consolidate site-specific contiguous authorizations upon request (FCC Form 601) of the licensee, if appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section. Paging licensees may include remote, stand-alone transmitters under the single system-wide authorization, if the remote, stand-alone transmitter is linked to the system via a control/repeater facility or by satellite. Including a remote, stand-alone transmitter in a system-wide authorization does not alter the limitations provided under § 22.503(f) on entities other than the paging geographic area licensee. In the alternative, paging licensees may maintain separate site-specific authorizations for stand-alone or remote transmitters. The earliest expiration date of the authorizations that make up the single system-wide authorization will determine the expiration date for the system-wide authorization. Licensees must file timely renewal applications for site-specific authorizations included in a single system-wide authorization request until the request is approved. Renewal of the system-wide authorization will be subject to § 1.949 of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Replacement of site-by-site authorizations with single authorization.</E> After a paging geographic area authorization for a channel has been issued, the FCC may, on its own motion, replace the authorization(s) of any other licensee (for facilities located within that paging geographic area on that channel) with a single replacement authorization.</P>

See § 22.567.</P>
                      <P>(b) A modification application in either service filed on the earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive applications of any type in either service to be “cut off” (excluded from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to § 22.131(c)(3)(ii) and § 22.131(c)(4).</P>

                        <P>The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria for the <PRTPAGE P="64"/>channels listed in § 22.531. These criteria permit channel assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public paging receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base transmitters.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Contour overlap.</E> The FCC may grant an application requesting assignment of a channel to a proposed base transmitter only if:</P>
                        <P>(1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel transmitter controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier has agreed in writing to accept any interference that may result from operation of the proposed transmitter; and,</P>
                        <P>(2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap the interfering contour of any protected co-channel transmitter controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the applicant agrees to accept any interference that may result from operation of the protected co-channel transmitter; and,</P>
                        <P>(3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by the proposed transmitter is substantial, and service gained would exceed that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Protected transmitter.</E> For the purposes of this section, protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a current FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed pending applications.</P>

                        <P>The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria for the channels listed in § 22.561. The criteria in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section permit channel assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public mobile receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and central office stations, including Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems (BETRS), in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Additional criteria in paragraph (g) of this section permit channel assignments to be made in a manner such that BETRS communications are protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and other central office stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Separate criteria in paragraph (h) of this section apply only to assignment of the channels designated in § 22.561 as mobile channels to base and fixed transmitters, and permit these channel assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public base and fixed receivers of signals from associated mobile and fixed transmitters is protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters.</P>

                        <P>Carriers may remotely control station functions (e.g. shut down or reactivate base transmitters, turn aviation obstruction warning lights on or off, etc.) using a control transmitter operating on a mobile channel, subject to the conditions in this section and in § 22.567(h).</P>
                        <P>(a) The control transmitter must be capable of overriding transmissions from subscriber-operated transmitters if necessary. Subscriber-operated transmitters must not be capable of being used to deliberately or accidentally prevent the licensee from controlling the station.</P>
                        <P>(b) The licensee must implement measures designed to prevent station functions from being controlled by persons not authorized by the licensee to control the station.</P>
                        <P>(c) The control transmitter location must be within the composite service contour of the licensee's authorized station on the paired base channel.</P>

                        <P>(1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers (144 miles),</P>
                        <P>(2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).</P>
                        <P>(3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Encompassment exhibit.</E> An exhibit showing that the area within the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally encompassed by interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications to operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-power limits of § 22.565. This encompassment exhibit may substitute <PRTPAGE P="71"/>for the interference exhibit required in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                        <P>Existing microwave stations (2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz) licensed under this part (pursuant to former rules) are subject to the transition rules in § 22.602. No new microwave systems will be authorized under this part.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Coordination required.</E> Before filing applications for authority to modify existing stations on these channels or major amendments to such applications, carriers must coordinate the planned channel usage, using the procedure outlined in § 22.150, with affected parties in this radio service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Service and the Multipoint Distribution Service. Affected parties are licensees and other applicants with previously filed pending applications whose stations could affect or be affected by the proposed modification of the existing station in terms of interference.</P>

All parties must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, a party receiving notification is not obligated to suggest changes or re-design a proposal in cases involving conflicts. The applicant must identify in the application all parties with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that technical problems are not resolved or if an affected party does not respond to coordination efforts within 30 days after notification, an explanation must be contained in the application. Where technical conflicts are resolved by an agreement between the parties that requires special procedures to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference (such as the use of artificial site shielding), or would result in a reduction of quality or capacity of either system, the details thereof must be contained in the application.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Transition of the 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz channels to emerging technologies.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>The 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz microwave channels formerly listed in § 22.591 have been re-allocated for use by emerging technologies (ET) services. No new systems will be authorized under this part. The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which existing Paging and Radiotelephone Service (PARS) licensees using these channels may relocate operations to other media or to other fixed channels, including those in other microwave bands. For PARS licensees relocating operations to other microwave bands, authorization must be obtained under part 101 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(a) Licensees proposing to implement ET services may negotiate with PARS licensees authorized to use these channels, for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the PARS licensees would—</P>
                        <P>(1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or other media, or alternatively,</P>
                        <P>(2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ET licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the PARS operations.</P>
                        <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
                        <P>(c) Relocation of fixed microwave licensees in the 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands will be subject to mandatory negotiations only. A separate mandatory negotiation period will commence for each fixed microwave licensee when an ET licensee informs that fixed microwave licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Mandatory negotiation periods are defined as follows:</P>
                        <P>(1) Non-public safety incumbents will have a two-year mandatory negotiation period; and</P>
                        <P>(2) Public safety incumbents will have a three-year mandatory negotiation period.</P>

                        <P>(d) The mandatory negotiation period is triggered at the option of the ET licensee. Once mandatory negotiations have begun, a PARS licensee may not <PRTPAGE P="73"/>refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the FCC will consider, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> the following factors:</P>
                        <P>(1) Whether the ET licensee has made a <E T="03">bona fide</E> offer to relocate the PARS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with Section 101.75(b) of this chapter;</P>

                        <P>(2) If the PARS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium requested (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> whether the premium is directly related to relocation, such as system-wide relocations and analog-to-digital conversions, versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is disproportionate (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> whether there is a lack of proportion or relation between the two);</P>
                        <P>(3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of relocation to comparable facilities;</P>
                        <P>(4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to facilitate the relocation process. Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.</P>
                        <P>(e) <E T="03">Involuntary period.</E> After the end of the mandatory negotiation period, ET licensees may initiate involuntary relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are obligated to pay to relocate only the specific microwave links to which their systems pose an interference problem. Under involuntary relocation, a PARS licensee is required to relocate, provided that:</P>
                        <P>(1) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expenses incurred by the PARS licensee that are directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay PARS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. ET licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by PARS licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the involuntary period is initiated or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable facilities;</P>
                        <P>(2) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative completes all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are involved, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbents behalf, new channels and frequency coordination; and,</P>
                        <P>(3) The ET applicant, provider, licensee or representative builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability with the existing 2 GHz system.</P>
                        <P>(f) <E T="03">Comparable Facilities.</E> The replacement system provided to an incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent to the existing PARS system with respect to the following three factors:</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Throughput.</E> Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is required to provide the PARS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, the ET licensee must provide the PARS licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide PARS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the PARS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the PARS system.</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Reliability.</E> System reliability is the degree to which information is <PRTPAGE P="74"/>transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must provide PARS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable reliability.</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Operating Costs.</E> Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the PARS system. ET licensees must compensate PARS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (e.g. additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the PARS licensee must be equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.</P>
                        <P>(g) The PARS licensee is not required to relocate until the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.</P>
                        <P>(h) [Reserved]</P>
                        <P>(i) After April 25, 1996, all major modifications and extensions to existing PARS systems operating on channels in the 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz bands will be authorized on a secondary basis to future ET operations. All other modifications will render the modified PARS license secondary to future ET operations unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent PARS licensee establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs of ET licensees. Incumbent PARS licensees will maintain primary status for the following technical changes:</P>
                        <P>(1) Decreases in power;</P>
                        <P>(2) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in antenna height;</P>
                        <P>(3) Minor location changes (up to two seconds);</P>
                        <P>(4) Any data correction which does not involve a change in the location of an existing facility;</P>
                        <P>(5) Reductions in authorized bandwidth;</P>
                        <P>(6) Minor changes (increases or decreases) in structure height;</P>
                        <P>(7) Changes (increases or decreases) in ground elevation that do not affect centerline height;</P>
                        <P>(8) Minor equipment changes.</P>
                        <P>(j) <E T="03">Sunset.</E> PARS licensees will maintain primary status in the 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands unless and until an ET licensee requires use of the spectrum. ET licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the relocation rules sunset (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, for the 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands, ten years after the first ET license is issued in the respective band). Once the relocation rules sunset, an ET licensee may require the incumbent to cease operations, provided that the ET licensee intends to turn on a system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by TIA TSB 10-F or any standard successor. ET licensee notification to the affected PARS licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month notice period has expired, the PARS licensee must turn its license back into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement which allows the PARS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon basis. If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if the incumbent can demonstrate that:</P>

                        <P>(1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, because no alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available), and;</P>

                        <P>(2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced to terminate operations (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, if public safety communications services would be disrupted).</P>
                        <P>(k) <E T="03">Reimbursement and relocation expenses in the 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands.</E> Whenever an ET licensee in <PRTPAGE P="75"/>the 2110-2130 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz band relocates a paired PARS link with one path in the 2110-2130 MHz band and the paired path in the 2160-2180 MHz band, the ET license will be entitled to reimbursement pursuant to the procedures described in §§ 27.1160 through 27.1174 of this chapter.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>System configuration.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to-multipoint systems using the channels listed in § 22.621.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">928-960 MHz.</E> The channels may be assigned, individually or paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. If a 932-933 MHz channel and a 941-942 MHz channel are assigned as a pair, the 941-942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control transmitters; the 932-933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or fixed relay transmitters.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">470-512 MHz.</E> These channels may be assigned only individually (unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed relay transmitters are not authorized.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Selection and assignment.</E> The FCC selects and assigns a channel when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to transmit in the 470-512, 932-933 and 941-942 MHz frequency ranges. Applicants having a preference may request the assignment of a specific channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to satisfy such requests.</P>

                        <P>This section governs where point-to-multipoint transmitters on the channels listed in § 22.621 may be located.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">928-960 MHz.</E> In this frequency range, the required minimum distance separation between co-channel fixed transmitters is 113 kilometers (70 miles).</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">470-512 MHz.</E> The purpose of the rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels are allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is to reduce the likelihood that interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur.</P>

For this purpose, the Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 kilometer (55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station location, and along which the median TV signal field strength is 64 dBµV/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio requirements of this section, all predicted field strengths must have been <PRTPAGE P="83"/>determined using the UHF TV propagation curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.</P>

                      <P>The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for central office stations that request a rural radiotelephone channel pair when the applicant has applied for or been granted an authorization for other rural radiotelephone channel pairs in the same area. The general policy of the FCC is to promote effective use of the spectrum by encouraging the use of spectrum-efficient technologies (i.e. BETRS) and by assigning the minimum number of channels necessary to provide service.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Transmitters in same area.</E> Any central office station transmitter on any channel pair listed in § 22.725 is considered to be in the same area as another central office station transmitter on any other channel pair listed in § 22.725 if the transmitting antennas are located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of each other.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial channel pairs.</E> The FCC does not assign more than two channel pairs for new central office stations, unless there are more than eight rural subscriber stations to be served. Stations are considered to be new if there are no authorized transmitters on any channel listed in § 22.725 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic area.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional channel pairs.</E> Applications for central office station transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized central office station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a different channel pair(s) are considered as requests for additional channel pair(s) for the authorized central office station. The FCC may grant applications for additional channel pairs provided that the need for each additional channel pair (after the first two) is established and fully justified in terms of achieving the required grade of service (blocking probability), and the applicant demonstrates that there will still be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic <PRTPAGE P="88"/>estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and rural radiotelephone services. In the case of conventional rural radiotelephone central office stations, an explanation must be provided as to why BETRS technology is not being used instead of additional channel pairs.</P>

                        <P>The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for authority to operate a ground station transmitter on any ground station communication channel listed in § 22.805 when the applicant has applied or been granted an authorization for other ground station communication channels in the same area. The general policy of the FCC is to assign one ground station communication channel in an area to a carrier per application cycle, up to a maximum of six ground station communication channels per area. That is, a carrier must apply for one ground station communication channel, receive the authorization, construct the station, and notify the FCC of commencement of service before applying for an additional ground station communication channel in that area.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Air-ground transmitters in same area.</E> Any transmitter on any of the ground station channels listed in § 22.805 is considered to be in the same area as another transmitter on any ground station channel listed in § 22.805 if it is located less than 350 kilometers (217 miles) from that transmitter.<PRTPAGE P="92"/>

                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial channel.</E> The FCC will not assign more than one ground station communication channel for new ground stations. Ground stations are considered to be new if there are no authorized ground station transmitters on any channel listed in § 22.805 controlled by the applicant in the same area.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional channel.</E> Applications for ground transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized ground station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a different ground station communication channel, are considered as requesting an additional channel for the authorized station.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendment of pending application.</E> If the FCC receives and accepts for filing an application for a ground station transmitter to be located in the same area as a ground station transmitter proposed in a pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on a different ground station communication channel, the subsequent application is treated as a major amendment to change the technical proposal of the prior application. The filing date of any application so amended is the date the FCC received the subsequent application.</P>
                        <P>(e) <E T="03">Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel.</E> If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station communication channel for an authorized ground station prior to receiving notification that the station is providing service to subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice.</P>
                        <P>(f) <E T="03">Dismissal of applications for seventh channel.</E> If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station communication channel for an authorized ground station which would, if granted, result in that station being assigned more than six ground station communication channels in the same area, the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice.</P>

                        <P>This section contains rules concerning continued operation of commercial aviation air-ground systems that were originally authorized prior to January 1, 2004 to provide radiotelephone service using narrowband (6 kHz) channels, and that have been providing service continuously since the original commencement of service (hereinafter “incumbent systems”).</P>

                        <P>(a) An incumbent system may continue to operate under its authorization, for the remaining term of such authorization, subject to the terms and conditions attached thereto. Wherever <PRTPAGE P="93"/>such technical and operational conditions differ from technical and operational rules in this subpart, those conditions shall govern its operations.</P>
                        <P>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the licensee of an incumbent system shall not be entitled to an expectation of renewal of said authorization.</P>
                        <P>(c) During the period that an incumbent system continues to operate and provide service pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, air-ground systems of licensees holding a new authorization for the spectrum within which the incumbent system operates must not cause interference to the incumbent system. Protection from interference requires that the signals of the new systems must not exceed a ground station received power of −130 dBm within a 6 kHz receive bandwidth, calculated assuming a 0 dBi vertically polarized receive antenna.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Emission limitations.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions for commercial aviation systems in the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service. Commercial aviation air-ground systems may use any type of emission or technology that complies with the technical rules in this subpart.</P>
                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Out of band emissions.</E> The power of any emission outside of the authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Measurement procedure.</E> Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz or greater. In the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, 100 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative out of band emission limit.</E> The licensee(s) of commercial aviation air-ground systems, together with affected licensees of Cellular Radiotelephone Service systems operating in the spectrum immediately below and adjacent to the commercial aviation air-ground bands, may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be used at the 849 MHz and 894 MHz band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Interference caused by out of band emissions.</E> If any emission from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.</P>

                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Interference analysis.</E> Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees—who receive an initial notification described in § 90.674(a) of this chapter—shall perform a timely analysis of the interference to identify the possible source. Immediate on-site visits may be conducted when necessary to complete timely analysis. Interference analysis must be completed and corrective action initiated within 48 hours of the initial complaint from a part 90 public safety/CII licensee. This response time may be extended to 96 hours after the initial complaint from other part 90 non-cellular licensees provided affected communications on these systems are not safety related.

                        <P>(1) Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees found to contribute to unacceptable interference, as defined in § 22.877, shall resolve such interference in the shortest time practicable. Commercial aviation air-ground system licensees must provide all necessary test apparatus and technical personnel skilled in the operation of such equipment as may be necessary to determine the most appropriate means of timely eliminating the interference. However, the means whereby interference is abated or the technical parameters that may need to be adjusted is left to the discretion of the commercial aviation air-ground system licensee, whose affirmative measures may include, but not be limited to, the following techniques:</P>
                        <P>(i) Increasing the desired power of the public safety/CII signal;</P>
                        <P>(ii) Decreasing the power of the commercial aviation air-ground system signal;</P>
                        <P>(iii) Modifying the commercial aviation air-ground system antenna height;</P>
                        <P>(iv) Modifying the commercial aviation air-ground system antenna characteristics;</P>
                        <P>(v) Incorporating filters into the commercial aviation air-ground system transmission equipment;</P>

                        <P>(vii) Supplying interference-resistant receivers to the affected public safety/CII licensee(s). If this technique is <PRTPAGE P="96"/>used, in all circumstances, commercial aviation air-ground system licensees shall be responsible for all costs thereof.</P>
                        <P>(2) Whenever short-term interference abatement measures prove inadequate, the affected part 90 non-cellular licensee shall, consistent with but not compromising safety, make all necessary concessions to accepting interference until a longer-term remedy can be implemented.</P>
                        <P>(3) When a part 90 public safety licensee determines that a continuing presence of interference constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, the licensee causing the interference must discontinue the associated operation immediately, until a remedy can be identified and applied. The determination that a continuing presence exists that constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, must be made by written statement that:</P>
                        <P>(i) Is in the form of a declaration, notarized affidavit, or statement under penalty or perjury, from an officer or executive of the affected public safety licensee;</P>
                        <P>(ii) Thoroughly describes the basis of the claim of clear and imminent danger;</P>
                        <P>(iii) Was formulated on the basis of either personal knowledge or belief after due diligence;</P>
                        <P>(iv) Is not proffered by a contractor or other third party; and,</P>
                        <P>(v) Has been approved by the Chief of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau or other designated Commission official. Prior to the authorized official making a determination that a clear and imminent danger exists, the associated written statement must be served by hand-delivery or receipted fax on the applicable offending licensee, with a copy transmitted by the fastest available means to the Washington, DC office of the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.</P>

                      <P>(a) Each cellular system must provide either mobile service, fixed service, or a combination of mobile and fixed service, subject to the requirements, limitations and exceptions in this section. Mobile service provided may be of any type, including two way radiotelephone, dispatch, one way or two way paging, and personal communications services (as defined in part 24 of this chapter). Fixed service is considered to be primary service, as is mobile service. When both mobile and fixed service are provided, they are considered to be co primary services. In providing cellular services, each cellular system may incorporate any technology that meets all applicable technical requirements in this part.</P>
                      <P>(b) Until February 18, 2008, each cellular system that provides two-way cellular mobile radiotelephone service must—</P>

                      <P>(1) Maintain the capability to provide compatible analog service (“AMPS”) to cellular telephones designed in conformance with the specifications contained in sections 1 and 2 of the standard document ANSI TIA/EIA-553-A-1999 Mobile Station—Base Station Compatibility Standard (approved October 14, 1999); or, the corresponding portions, applicable to mobile stations, of whichever of the predecessor standard documents was in effect at the time of the manufacture of the telephone. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

                      <SUBJECT>Cellular geographic service area.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>The Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) of a cellular system is the geographic area considered by the FCC to be served by the cellular system. The CGSA is the area within which cellular systems are entitled to protection and within which adverse effects for the purpose of determining whether a petitioner has standing are recognized.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">CGSA determination.</E> The CGSA is the composite of the service areas of all of the cells in the system, excluding any area outside the cellular market boundary, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and excluding any area within the CGSA of another cellular system. The service area of a cell is the area within its service area boundary (SAB). The distance to the SAB is calculated as a function of effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna center of radiation height above average terrain (HAAT), height above sea level (HASL) or height above mean sea level (HAMSL).<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
                      </P>

                      <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna to its SAB along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:

                      <P>(2) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna located in the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA) to its SAB along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:
                      </P>

                      <P>(3) The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not be less than 8 meters (26 feet) HASL (or HAMSL, as appropriate for the support structure). The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must not be less than 30 meters (98 feet) HAAT, except that for unserved area applications proposing a cell with an ERP not exceeding 10 Watts, the value for h used in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine the service area boundary for that cell may be less than 30 meters (98 feet) HAAT, but not less than 3 meters (10 feet) HAAT.</P>
                      <P>(4) The value used for p in the formulas in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section must not be less than 0.1 Watt or 27 dB less than (1/500 of) the maximum ERP in any direction, whichever is more.</P>
                      <P>(5) Whenever use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section pursuant to the exception contained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section results in a calculated distance that is less than 5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles), the radial distance to the service area boundary is deemed to be 5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles).</P>
                      <P>(6) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna to the SAB along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials is calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternative CGSA determination</E>. If a carrier believes that the method described in paragraph (a) of this section produces a CGSA that departs significantly (±20% in the service area of any cell) from the geographic area where reliable cellular service is actually provided, the carrier may submit, as an exhibit to an application for modification of the CGSA using FCC Form 601, a depiction of what the carrier believes the CGSA should be. Such submissions must be accompanied by one or more supporting propagation studies using methods appropriate for the 800-900 MHz frequency range, including all supporting data and calculations, and/or by extensive field strength measurement data. For the purpose of such submissions, cellular service is considered to be provided in all areas, including “dead spots”, between the transmitter location and the locus of points where the predicted or measured median field strength finally drops to 32 dBµV/m (i.e. does not exceed 32 dBµV/m further out). If, after consideration of such submissions, the FCC finds that adjustment to a CGSA is warranted, the FCC may grant the application.</P>
                      <P>(1) The alternative CGSA determination must define the CGSA in terms of distances from the cell sites to the 32 dBuV/m contour along the eight cardinal radials, with points in other azimuthal directions determined by the method given in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The distances used for the cardinal radials must be representative of the coverage within the 45° sectors, as depicted by the alternative CGSA determination.</P>

                      <P>(2) If an uncalibrated predictive model is used to depict the CGSA, the alternative CGSA determination must identify factors (e.g. terrain roughness or features) that could plausibly account for the difference between actual coverage and that defined by the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If actual measurements or a measurement-calibrated predictive model are used to depict the CGSA, and this fact is disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination, it is not necessary to offer an explanation of the difference between actual coverage and that defined by the formula in paragraph (a)(1) <PRTPAGE P="100"/>of this section. If the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is clearly inapplicable for the cell(s) in question (e.g. for microcells), this should be disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination.</P>

                      <P>(3) The provision for alternative CGSA determinations was made in recognition that the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is a general model that provides a reasonable approximation of coverage in most land areas, but may under-predict or over-predict coverage in specific areas with unusual terrain roughness or features, and may be inapplicable for certain purposes, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, cells with a coverage radius of less than 8 kilometers (5 miles). In such cases, alternative methods that utilize more specific models are appropriate. Accordingly, the FCC does not consider use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with parameters outside of the limits in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section or with data for radials other than the cardinal radials to be a valid alternative method for determining the CGSA of a cellular system.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">CGSA extension areas.</E> SAB extensions (areas outside of the cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the methods of paragraph (a) of this section) are part of the CGSA only under the following circumstances:</P>
                      <P>(1) During the five year build-out period of the system in the cellular market containing the extension, the licensees of systems on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree that the portion of the service area of one system that extends into unserved areas in the other system's cellular market is part of the CGSA of the former system.</P>
                      <P>(2) At the end of the five year build-out period of the system in the cellular market containing the extension, the portion of the service area that extends into unserved areas in another cellular market becomes part of the CGSA, provided that the licensee of the system so extended files a system information update in accordance with § 22.947(c).</P>
                      <P>(3) For original systems in MSAs, extensions of the CGSA authorized by the FCC are part of the CGSA to the extent authorized.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Protection afforded.</E> Within the CGSA determined in accordance with this section, cellular systems are entitled to protection from co-channel and first-adjacent channel interference and from capture of subscriber traffic by adjacent systems on the same channel block.</P>
                      <P>(1) Licensees must cooperate in resolving co-channel and first-adjacent channel interference by changing channels used at specific cells or by other technical means.</P>
                      <P>(2) Protection from capture of subscriber traffic is applied and limited in accordance with the following:</P>
                      <P>(i) Subscriber traffic is captured if an SAB of one cellular system overlaps the CGSA of another operating cellular system. Therefore, cellular licensees must not begin to operate any facility that would cause an SAB to overlap the existing CGSA of another cellular system on the same channel block, without first obtaining the written consent of the licensee of that system. However, cellular licensees may continue to operate existing facilities that produce an SAB overlapping a subsequently-authorized portion of the CGSA of another cellular system on the same channel block until the licensee of that system requests that the SAB be removed from its CGSA. Such request may be made directly to the licensee of the overlapping system or to the FCC. In the event such request is made, the licensee of the overlapping system must reduce the transmitting power or antenna height (or both) at the pertinent cell site as necessary to remove the SAB from the CGSA of the other system, unless a written consent from the licensee of the other system allowing the SAB to remain is obtained. Cellular licensees may enter into contracts with the licensees of other cellular systems on the same channel block to allow SABs to overlap CGSAs.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Cellular licensees are at most entitled to have a CGSA free of SABs from other cellular systems on the same channel block.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Unserved areas.</E> Unserved areas are areas outside of all existing CGSAs (on either of the channel blocks), to which <PRTPAGE P="101"/>the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, is applicable.</P>

SAB extensions are areas outside of the cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the methods of § 22.911(a). Cellular systems must be designed to comply with the rules in this section. Applications proposing systems that would not comply with the rules in this section are defective. Service within SAB extensions is not protected from interference or capture under § 22.911(d) unless and until the area within the SAB extension becomes a part of the cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in accordance with § 22.911(c).</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">De minimis extensions.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, SABs may be extended into adjacent cellular markets if such extensions are <E T="03">de minimis</E>, are demonstrably unavoidable for technical reasons of sound engineering design, and do not extend into the CGSA of any other licensee's cellular system on the same channel block, any part of the Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone (GMEZ), or into any adjacent cellular market on a channel block for which the five year build-out period has expired.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract extensions.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, cellular system licensees may enter into contracts to allow SAB extensions as follows:</P>
                      <P>(1) The licensee of any cellular system may, at any time, enter into a contract with an applicant for, or licensee of, a cellular system on the same channel block in an adjacent cellular market, to allow one or more SAB extensions into its CGSA only (not into unserved area).</P>
                      <P>(2) The licensee of the first authorized cellular system on each channel block in the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA) may enter into a contract with an applicant for, or licensee of, a cellular system on the same channel block in an adjacent cellular market or in the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone (GMCZ), to allow one or more SAB extensions into the Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone.</P>
                      <P>(3) The licensee of the first authorized cellular system on each channel block in each cellular market may enter into a contract with an applicant for or licensee of a cellular system on the same channel block in an adjacent cellular market, to allow one or more SAB extensions into its CGSA and/or unserved area in its cellular market, during its five year build-out period.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract extensions.</E> Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of cellular systems on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may, at any time, enter into contracts with applicants or other licensees to allow SAB extensions into their CGSA only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of the first authorized cellular systems on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree to allow SAB extensions into their CGSA and/or unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year build-out period of the market into which the SAB extends.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Same applicant/licensee.</E> Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of cellular systems that are also an applicant or licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may, at any time, allow or propose SAB extensions from their adjacent market system into their CGSH only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of the first authorized cellular systems that are also an applicant or licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may allow or propose SAB extensions from their adjacent market system into their CGSA and/or unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year build-out period of the market into which the SAB extends.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Unserved area systems.</E> Phase I initial cellular applications must not propose SAB extensions. Phase I sole major modification applications and Phase II applications may propose SAB <PRTPAGE P="102"/>extensions, subject to the conditions in this section.</P>

                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Maximum ERP.</E> In general, the effective radiated power (ERP) of base transmitters and cellular repeaters must not exceed 500 Watts. However, for those systems operating in areas more than 72 km (45 miles) from international borders that:</P>
                      <P>(1) Are located in counties with population densities of 100 persons or fewer per square mile, based upon the most recently available population statistics from the Bureau of the Census; or,</P>

The ERP of mobile transmitters and auxiliary test transmitters must not exceed 7 Watts.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Height-power limit.</E> The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed the amount that would result in an average distance to the service area boundary of 79.1 kilometers (49 miles) for cellular systems authorized to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA and 40.2 kilometers (25 miles) for all other cellular systems. The average distance to the service area boundary is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures specified in § 22.911 for the eight cardinal radial directions.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Coordination exemption.</E> Licensees need not comply with the height-power limit in paragraph (b) of this section if the proposed operation is coordinated with the licensees of all affected cellular systems on the same channel block within 121 kilometers (75 miles) and concurrence is obtained.</P>

                      <P>The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Out of band emissions.</E> The power of any emission outside of the authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log(P) dB.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Measurement procedure.</E> Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kHz or greater. In the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (<E T="03">i.e.</E> 100 kHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative out of band emission limit.</E> Licensees in this service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Interference caused by out of band emissions.</E> If any emission from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>The procedures in this section apply to comparative renewal proceedings in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.</P>
                      <P>(a) If one or more of the applications competing with an application for renewal of a cellular authorization are filed, the renewal applicant must file with the Commission its original renewal expectancy showing electronically via the ULS. This filing must be submitted no later than 60 days after the date of the Public Notice listing as acceptable for filing the renewal application and the competing applications.</P>
                      <P>(b) Interested parties may file petitions to deny any of the mutually exclusive applications. Any such petitions to deny must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Applicants may file replies to any petitions to deny applications that are filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) to deny was filed. No further pleadings will be accepted.</P>
                      <P>(c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing applications will be designated for a two-step procedure. An Administrative Law Judge (Presiding Judge) will conduct a threshold hearing (step one), in which both the licensee and the competing applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant deserves a renewal expectancy. If the order designating the applications for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee, those issues will be tried in this threshold hearing. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant is basically qualified and due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be found ineligible for further consideration and their applications will be denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all of the applications will be considered in a comparative hearing (step two).</P>
                      <P>(d) Any competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold hearing (step one), if such applicant demonstrates that its proposal so far exceeds the service already being provided that there would be no purpose in making a threshold determination as to whether the renewal applicant deserved a renewal expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing applicant. Any such waiver request must be filed at the time the requestor's application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver requests may be filed. Any such petitions must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Replies to any petitions opposing such waiver requests may be filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) were filed. No further pleadings will be accepted. Any waiver request submitted pursuant to this paragraph will be acted upon prior to designating the applications for hearing. If a request to waive the threshold hearing (step one) is granted, the renewal expectancy issue will be designated as part of the comparative hearing (step two), and will remain the most important comparative factor in deciding the case, as provided in § 22.940(a).</P>

                      <P>(e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the threshold (step one) that <PRTPAGE P="105"/>denies the licensee a renewal expectancy, all of the applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed to file direct cases no later than 90 days after the release date of the Presiding Judge's ruling. Rebuttal cases must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the direct cases were filed.</P>
                      <P>(f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures delineated in this paragraph in both threshold (step one) and comparative (step two) hearings conducted in comparative cellular renewal proceedings.</P>
                      <P>(1) The Presiding Judge will schedule a first hearing session as soon as practicable after the date for filing rebuttal evidence. This first session will be an evidentiary admission session at which each applicant will identify and offer its previously circulated direct and rebuttal exhibits, and each party will have an opportunity to lodge objections.</P>
                      <P>(2) After accepting the exhibits into evidence, the Presiding Judge will entertain motions to cross-examine and rule whether any sponsoring witness needs to be produced for cross-examination.</P>
                      <P>Determination of what, if any, cross-examination is necessary is within the sound judicial discretion of the Presiding Judge, the prevailing standard being whether the person requesting cross-examination has persuasively demonstrated that written evidence is ineffectual to develop proof. If cross-examination is necessary, the Presiding Judge will specify a date for the appearance of all witnesses. In addition, if the designation order points out an area where additional underlying data is needed, the Presiding Judge will have the authority to permit the limited use of discovery procedures. Finally, the Presiding Judge may find that certain additional testimony or cross-examination is needed to provide a complete record for the FCC. If so, the Presiding Judge may schedule a further session.</P>
                      <P>(3) After the hearing record is closed, the Presiding Judge may request Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to be filed no later than 30 days after the final hearing session. Replies are not permitted except in unusual cases and then only with respect to the specific issues named by the Presiding Judge.</P>
                      <P>(4) The Presiding Judge will then issue an Initial Decision, preferably within 60 days of receipt of the last pleadings. If mutually exclusive applications are before the Presiding Judge, the Presiding Judge will determine which applicant is best qualified. The Presiding Judge may also rank the applicants in order of merit if there are more than two.</P>
                      <P>(5) Parties will have 30 days in which to file exceptions to the Initial Decision.</P>

                      <P>(2) Applications are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the time the application is filed with the FCC until such time as an order of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application is no longer subject to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.</P>
                      <P>(3) “Legitimate and prudent expenses” are those expenses reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing, prosecuting and/or settling its application for which reimbursement is sought.</P>

                      <P>This section sets forth criteria to be used in comparative cellular renewal proceedings. The ultimate issue in comparative renewal proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in the proceeding, what disposition of the applications would best serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Renewal expectancies.</E> The most important comparative factor to be considered in a comparative cellular renewal proceeding is a major preference, commonly referred to as a “renewal expectancy.”</P>
                      <P>(1) The cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy, if its past record for the relevant license period demonstrates that:</P>
                      <P>(i) The renewal applicant has provided “substantial” service during its past license term. “Substantial” service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal; and</P>
                      <P>(ii) The renewal applicant has substantially compiled with applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>

                      <P>(2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a cellular renewal <PRTPAGE P="107"/>applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include.</P>
                      <P>(i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic coverage and population served, as well as the system's ability to accommodate the needs of roamers;</P>
                      <P>(ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable of the construction of new cell sites to meet changes in demand for cellular service;</P>
                      <P>(iii) A description of its investments in its cellular system; and</P>
                      <P>(iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph.</P>
                      <P>(3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification application is dismissed or denied.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional comparative issues.</E> The following additional comparative issues will be included in comparative cellular renewal proceedings, if a full comparative hearing is conducted pursuant to § 22.935(c).</P>
                      <P>(1) To determine on a comparative basis the geographic areas and population that each applicant proposes to serve; to determine and compare the relative demand for the services proposed in said areas; and to determine and compare the ability of each applicant's cellular system to accommodate the anticipated demand for both local and roamer service;</P>

                      <P>(2) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's proposal for expanding its system capacity in a coordinated manner in order to meet anticipated increasing demand for <E T="03">both</E> local and roamer service;</P>
                      <P>(3) To determine on a comparative basis the nature and extent of the service proposed by each applicant, including each applicant's proposed rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications, regulations and facilities (including switching capabilities); and</P>
                      <P>(4) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's past performance in the cellular industry or another business of comparable type and size.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional showings for competing applications.</E> With respect to evidence introduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any applicant filing a competing application against a cellular renewal application (competing applicant) who claims a preference for offering any service not currently offered by the incumbent licensee must demonstrate that there is demand for that new service and also present a business plan showing that the competing applicant can operate the system economically. Any competing applicant who proposes to replace analog technology with digital technology will receive no credit for its proposal unless it submits a business plan showing how it will operate its system economically and how it will provide more comprehensive service than does the incumbent licensee with existing and implemented cellular technology.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Limitations on transfer of control and assignment for authorizations issued as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>Except as otherwise provided in this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that has been acquired by the current licensee for the first time as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding until the system has provided service to subscribers for at least three years.</P>
                      <P>(a) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that is to be transferred as a part of a bona fide sale of an on-going business to which the cellular operation is incidental.</P>

                      <P>(b) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that is to be transferred as a result of the death of the licensee.<PRTPAGE P="108"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(c) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Five year build-out period.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>Except for systems authorized in the Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Zone, the licensee of the first cellular system authorized on each channel block in each cellular market is afforded a five year period, beginning on the date the initial authorization for the system is granted, during which it may expand the system within that market.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Exclusive right to expand within market.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in any unserved area in a market on a channel block during the five year build-out period.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Partitioned markets</E>. During the five-year build-out period, the licensee of the first cellular system on each channel block in each market may enter into contracts with eligible parties, allowing such parties to apply by using FCC Form 601 for a new cellular system in that channel block within the market. The FCC may grant such applications if they are in compliance with the rules in this part. Markets with two or more authorized cellular systems on the same channel block during the five year build-out period are referred to (with respect to the affected channel block) as “partitioned markets”.</P>
                      <P>(1) Partitioning contracts must define the CGSA of the subsequent cellular system in accordance with § 22.911, including any expansion rights ceded. If not exercised, any such expansion rights terminate at the end of the five year build-out period.</P>
                      <P>(2) The five year build-out period begins on the date the initial authorization for the first cellular system is granted, and is not extended or affected in any way by the initial authorization of any subsequent cellular systems pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">System information update</E>. Sixty days before the end of the five year build-out period, the licensee of each cellular system authorized on each channel block in each cellular market <PRTPAGE P="109"/>must file, in triplicate, a system information update (SIU), comprising a full size map, a reduced map, and an exhibit showing technical data relevant to determination of the system's CGSA. Separate maps must be submitted for each market into which the CGSA extends, showing the extension area in the adjacent market. Maps showing extension areas must be labeled (<E T="03">i.e.</E> marked with the market number and channel block) for the market into which the CGSA extends. SIUs must accurately depict the relevant cell locations and coverage of the system at the end of the five year build-out period. SIUs must be filed at the Federal Communications Commission, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, Mobility Division, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20554. If any changes to the system occur after the filing of the SIU, but before the end of the five year build-out period, the licensee must file, in triplicate, additional maps and/or data as necessary to insure that the cell locations and coverage of the system as of the end of the five year build-out period are accurately depicted.</P>
                      <P>(1) The scale of the full-size map must be 1:500,000, regardless of whether any different scale is used for the reduced map. The map must have a legend, a distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and longitude lines. The map must be clear and legible. The map must accurately show the cell sites (transmitting antenna locations) which determine the CGSA, the entire CGSA, any extension of the composite service are boundary beyond the CGSA (see § 22.911) and the relevant portions of the cellular market boundary. The date on which the map depictions are accurate must appear on the map.</P>
                      <P>(2) The reduced map must be a proportional reduction, to 8<FR>1/2</FR>×11 inches, of the full-size map required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire market by reducing the full-size map. In such instance, an 8<FR>1/2</FR>×11 inch map of a different scale may be substituted, provided that the required features of the full-size map are clearly depicted and labeled.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Unserved area licensing process.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>This section sets forth the process for licensing unserved areas in cellular markets on channel blocks for which the five year build-out period has expired. This process has two phases: Phase I and Phase II. This section also sets forth the Phase II process applicable to applications to serve the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Zone.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Phase I.</E> Phase I is a one-time process that provides an opportunity for eligible parties to file competing applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in or to expand an existing cellular system into unserved areas (Phase I initial applications) as soon as these areas become available. In addition, each licensee whose Phase I initial application is granted is afforded one opportunity during the Phase I process to file an application proposing major modifications to the cellular system authorized by that grant (a Phase I major modification application), without being subject to competing applications.</P>
                      <P>(1) Phase I initial applications must be filed on the 31st day after the expiration of the five year build-out period of the authorized system(s) on the channel block requested in the market containing the unserved area.</P>
                      <P>(i) Each Phase I application must request authorization for one and only one cellular geographic service area (CGSA) in one and only one cellular market.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Applicants must not file more than one Phase I initial application for any cellular market.</P>

                      <P>(iii) Phase I initial applications must not propose any <E T="03">de minimis</E> or contract service area boundary (SAB) extensions.</P>

                      <P>(2) Only one Phase I initial application is granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, whenever two or more acceptable Phase I initial applications are timely filed in the same market on the same channel block, such Phase I initial applications are mutually exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications to grant, the Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the winning bidder may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice.
                      </P>
                      <NOTE>
                        <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                        <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of § 22.949(a)(2), mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications that were filed between March 10, 1993 and July 25, 1993, inclusive, are to be included in a random selection process, following which the selected application may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice.</P>
                      </NOTE>
                      
                      <P>(3) Phase I major modification applications (applications filed during Phase I that propose major modifications to cellular systems authorized by the grant of Phase I initial applications) must be filed no later than 90 days after the grant of the Phase I initial application. Each Phase I licensee may file only one Phase I major modification application. The FCC will not accept any competing applications in response to a Phase I major modification application. Phase I licensees may not sell to a third party any rights to apply for unserved area.</P>

                      <P>(i) Phase I major modification applications may propose <E T="03">de minimis</E> or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into an adjacent market may be proposed only if, at the time the Phase I major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent market (on the requested channel block) has the right to enter into such a contract (see § 22.912(c)).</P>
                      <P>(ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed CGSA, provided that the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of § 22.951.</P>
                      <P>(4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or notifications of minor modifications to its system. However, such minor modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum coverage requirement of § 22.951.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Phase II.</E> Phase II is an on-going filing process that allows eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas <PRTPAGE P="111"/>that may remain in a market after the Phase I process is complete.</P>
                      <P>(1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications (applications for authority to operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 121st day after the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications are granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st day after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no Phase I initial applications are received for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 32nd day after the expiration of the relevant five-year build-out period.</P>
                      <P>(2) There is no limit to the number of Phase II applications that may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Mutually exclusive applications are processed using the general procedures in § 22.131.</P>

                      <P>(3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one cellular market. Each Phase II application must request authorization for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose <E T="03">de minimis</E> and contract SAB extensions.</P>
                      <P>(c) Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually exclusive applications for unserved areas (partial settlements) are prohibited. Settlements among all applicants with mutually exclusive applications (full settlements) are allowed and must be filed no later than the date that the FCC Form 175 (short-form) is filed.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on amendments</E>. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.927 of this chapter, Phase I applications are subject to the following additional limitations in regard to the filing of amendments.</P>
                      <P>(1) The Commission will not accept amendments (of any type) to mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion of the competitive bidding process.</P>
                      <P>(2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I applications.</P>
                      <P>(3) Minor amendments required by § 1.65 of this chapter must be filed no later than thirty (30) days after public notice announcing the results of the competitive bidding process.</P>

                      <P>(1) A transceiver at a site at which interference is encountered:</P>
                      <P>(i) Is in good repair and operating condition, and is receiving:</P>
                      <P>(A) A median desired signal of −104 dBm or higher, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver of a mobile unit; or</P>

                      <P>(B) A median desired signal of −101 dBm or higher, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver of a portable <E T="03">i.e.</E> hand-held unit; and, either</P>
                      <P>(ii) Is a voice transceiver:</P>
                      <P>(A) With manufacturer published performance specifications for the receiver section of the transceiver equal to, or exceeding, the minimum standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, below; and;</P>
                      <P>(B) Receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the measured Carrier to Noise plus interference (C/(I+N)) ratio of the receiver section of said transceiver to be less than 20 dB, or,</P>
                      <P>(iii) Is a non-voice transceiver receiving an undesired signal or signals which cause the measured bit error rate (BER) (or some comparable specification) of the receiver section of said transceiver to be more than the value reasonably designated by the manufacturer.</P>
                      <P>(2) Provided, however, that if the receiver section of the mobile or portable voice transceiver does not conform to the standards set out in paragraph (b) of this section, then that transceiver shall be deemed subject to unacceptable interference only at sites where the median desired signal satisfies the applicable threshold measured signal power in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section after an upward adjustment to account for the difference in receiver section performance. The upward adjustment shall be equal to the increase in the desired signal required to restore the receiver section of the subject transceiver to the 20 dB C/(I+N) ratio of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The adjusted threshold levels shall then define the minimum measured signal power(s) in lieu of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section at which the licensee using such non-compliant transceiver is entitled to interference protection.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimum receiver requirements</E>. Voice transceivers capable of operating in the 806-824 MHz portion of the 800 MHz band shall have the following minimum performance specifications in order for the system in which such transceivers are used to claim entitlement to full protection against unacceptable interference (See paragraph (a) (2) of this section).</P>
                      <P>(1) Voice units intended for mobile use: 75 dB intermodulation rejection ratio; 75 dB adjacent channel rejection ratio; −116 dBm reference sensitivity.</P>

However, the means whereby interference is abated or the cell parameters that may need to be adjusted is left to the discretion of the Cellular Radiotelephone and/or part 90 of this chapter—800 MHz cellular system licensees, whose affirmative measures may include, but not be limited to, the following techniques:</P>
                      <P>(i) Increasing the desired power of the public safety/CII signal;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Decreasing the power of the part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone system signal;</P>
                      <P>(iii) Modifying the part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone system antenna height;</P>
                      <P>(iv) Modifying the part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone system antenna characteristics;</P>
                      <P>(v) Incorporating filters into part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone transmission equipment;</P>
                      <P>(vi) Permanently changing part 90 ESMR and/or Cellular Radiotelephone frequencies; and</P>
                      <P>(vii) Supplying interference-resistant receivers to the affected public safety/CII licensee(s). If this technique is used, in all circumstances, Cellular Radiotelephone and/or part 90 of this chapter ESMR licensees shall be responsible for all costs thereof.</P>
                      <P>(2) Whenever short-term interference abatement measures prove inadequate, the affected part 90 of this chapter non-cellular licensee shall, consistent with but not compromising safety, make all necessary concessions to accepting interference until a longer-term remedy can be implemented.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Discontinuing operations when clear imminent danger exists.</E> When a part 90 of this chapter public safety licensee determines that a continuing presence of interference constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, the licensee causing the interference must discontinue the associated operation immediately, until a remedy can be identified and applied. The determination that a continuing presence exists that constitutes a clear and imminent danger to life or property, must be made by written statement that:</P>
                      <P>(i) Is in the form of a declaration, notarized affidavit, or statement under penalty or perjury, from an officer or executive of the affected public safety licensee;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Thoroughly describes the basis of the claim of clear and imminent danger;</P>
                      <P>(iii) Was formulated on the basis of either personal knowledge or belief after due diligence;</P>
                      <P>(iv) Is not proffered by a contractor or other third party; and</P>
                      <P>(v) Has been approved by the Chief of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau or other designated Commission official. Prior to the authorized official making a determination that a clear and imminent danger exists, the associated written statement must be served by hand-delivery or receipted fax on the applicable offending licensee, with a copy transmitted by the fastest available means to the Washington, DC office of the Commission's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau.</P>

Public safety/CII licensees are not afforded the right to accept or reject the activation of a proposed cell or to unilaterally require changes in its operating parameters. The principal purposes of notification are to:</P>
                      <P>(1) Allow a public safety licensee to advise the part 90 of this chapter ESMR or Cellular Radiotelephone licensee whether it believes a proposed cell will generate unacceptable interference;</P>
                      <P>(2) Permit Cellular Radiotelephone or part 90 of this chapter ESMR licensees to make voluntary changes in cell parameters when a public safety licensee alerts them to possible interference; and</P>
                      <P>(3) Rapidly identify the source if interference is encountered when the cell is activated.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Construction requirements.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Nationwide narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 750,000 square kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the U.S. population within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 1,500,000 square kilometers or serve 75 percent of the U.S. population within ten years of initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(b) Regional narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 300,000 square kilometers or serve 75 percent of the service area population within ten years of initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

                      <P>(c) MTA narrowband PCS licensees shall construct base stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 75,000 square kilometers or 25 percent of the geographic area, or serve 37.5 percent of the population of the service area within five years of initial license grant date; and, shall construct base <PRTPAGE P="128"/>stations that provide coverage to a composite area of 150,000 square kilometers or 50 percent of the geographic area, or serve 75 percent of the population of the service area within ten years of initial license grant date. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to the licensed area as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(d) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, narrowband PCS licensees may demonstrate that, no later than ten years after the initial grant of their license, they provide substantial service to their licensed area. Licensees choosing this option must notify the FCC by filing FCC Form 601, no later than 15 days after the end of the five year period following the initial grant of their license, that they plan to satisfy the alternative requirement to provide substantial service. “Substantial service” is defined as service that is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service that would barely warrant renewal.</P>
                      <P>(e) In demonstrating compliance with the construction requirements set forth in this section, licensees must base their calculations on signal field strengths that ensure reliable service for the technology utilized. Licensees may determine the population of geographic areas included within their service contours using either the 1990 census or the 2000 census, but not both.</P>

                      <P>(1) For the purpose of this section, the service radius of a base station may be calculated using the following formula:

                      <P>(2) Alternatively, licensees may use any service radius contour formula developed or generally used by industry, provided that such formula is based on the technical characteristics of their system.</P>
                      <P>(f) Upon meeting the five and ten year benchmarks in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, or upon meeting the substantial service alternative in paragraph (d), licensees shall notify the Commission by filing FCC Form 601 and including a map and other supporting documentation that demonstrate the required geographic area coverage, population coverage, or substantial service to the licensed area. The notification must be filed with the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the relevant period.</P>
                      <P>(g) If the sale of a license is approved, the new licensee is held to the original build-out requirement.</P>
                      <P>(h) Failure by a licensee to meet the above construction requirements shall result in forfeiture of the license and ineligibility to regain it.</P>

                      <P>(a) Licensees of 30 MHz blocks must serve with a signal level sufficient to provide adequate service to at least one-third of the population in their licensed area within five years of being licensed and two-thirds of the population in their licensed area within ten years of being licensed. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to their licensed area within the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks. Licensees may choose to define population using the 1990 census or the 2000 census. Failure by any licensee to meet these requirements will result in forfeiture or non-renewal of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</P>

Population is defined as the 1990 population census. Licensees may elect to use the 2000 population census to determine the five-year construction requirement. Failure by any licensee to meet these requirements will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</P>
                      <P>(c) Licensees must file maps and other supporting documents showing compliance with the respective construction requirements within the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks of the date of their initial licenses.</P>
                      <P>(d) Licensees in the paired 1910-1915 MHz and 1990-1995 MHz bands must make a showing of “substantial service” in their license area within ten years of the date of initial license issuance or renewal. “Substantial service” is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Interference protection.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) All licensees are required to coordinate their frequency usage with the co-channel or adjacent channel incumbent fixed microwave licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz band. Coordination must occur before initiating operations from any base station. Problems that arise during the coordination process are to be resolved by the parties to the coordination. Licensees are required to coordinate with all users possibly affected, as determined by Appendix I to this subpart E (Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, FCC 94-144; TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F, “Interference Criteria for Microwave Systems,” May 1994, (TSB10-F)); or an alternative method agreed to by the parties.</P>
                      <P>(b) The results of the coordination process need to be reported to the Commission only if the parties fail to agree. Because broadband PCS licensees are required to protect fixed microwave licensees in the 1850-1990 MHz band, the Commission will be involved in the coordination process only upon complaint of interference from a fixed microwave licensee. In such a case, the Commission will resolve the issues.</P>
                      <P>(c) In all other respects, coordination procedures are to follow the requirements of § 101.103(d) of this chapter to the extent that these requirements are not inconsistent with those specified in this part.</P>
                      <P>(d) The licensee must perform an engineering analysis to assure that the proposed facilities will not cause interference to existing OFS stations within the coordination distance specified in Table 3 of a magnitude greater than that specified in the criteria set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, unless there is prior agreement with the affected OFS licensee. Interference calculations shall be based on the sum of the power received at the terminals of each microwave receiver from all of the applicant's current and proposed PCS operations.</P>

                      <P>(e) For microwave paths of 25 kilometers or less, interference determinations shall be based on the C/I criteria set forth in TIA Telecommunications Systems Bulletin 10-F, “Interference <PRTPAGE P="136"/>Criteria for Microwave Systems,” May 1994 (TSB10-F).</P>
                      <P>(f) For microwave paths longer than 25 kilometers, the interference protection criterion shall be such that the interfering signal will not produce more than 1.0 dB degradation of the practical threshold of the microwave receiver for analog system, or such that the interfering signal will not cause an increase in the bit error rate (BER) from 10E-6 to 10E-5 for digital systems.</P>
                      <P>(g) The development of the C/I ratios and interference criteria specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and the methods employed to compute the interfering power at the microwave receivers shall follow generally acceptable good engineering practices. The procedures described for computing interfering signal levels in (Appendix I to this subpart E Appendix E of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, GEN Docket No. 90-314, FCC 94-144) shall be applied. Alternatively, procedures for determining interfering signal levels and other criteria as may be developed by the Electronics Industries Association (EIA), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or any other recognized authority will be acceptable to the Commission.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Emission limitations for Broadband PCS equipment.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions in the Broadband Personal Communications Service.</P>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Out of band emissions.</E> The power of any emission outside of the authorized operating frequency ranges must be attenuated below the transmitting power (P) by a factor of at least 43 + 10 log(P) dB.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Measurement procedure.</E> Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (<E T="03">i.e.</E> 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative out of band emission limit.</E> Licensees in this service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Interference caused by out of band emissions.</E> If any emission from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to users of another radio service, the FCC may require a greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.</P>

In accordance with procedures specified in §§ 101.69 through 101.81 of this chapter, PCS entities (both licensed and unlicensed) are required to relocate the existing Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) licensees in these bands if interference to the existing FMS operations would occur. All PCS entities who benefit from spectrum clearance by other PCS entities or a voluntarily relocating <PRTPAGE P="137"/>microwave incumbent, must contribute to such relocation costs. PCS entities may satisfy this requirement by entering into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than those specified in § 24.243. However, PCS entities are required to reimburse other PCS entities or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbents that incur relocation costs and are not parties to the alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a private cost-sharing agreement may seek reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed in § 24.241) from PCS entities that are not parties to the agreement. The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all phases of microwave relocation specified in § 101.69 of this chapter. If a licensee in the Broadband PCS Service enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement (as set forth in part 1, subpart X of this chapter) and the spectrum lessee triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee is the PCS entity responsible for satisfying the cost-sharing obligations under §§ 24.239 through 24.253.</P>

                        <P>The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, will select an entity to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit clearinghouse. This clearinghouse will administer the cost-sharing plan by, <E T="03">inter alia</E>, maintaining all of the cost and payment records related to the relocation of each link and determining the cost-sharing obligation of subsequent PCS entities. The cost-sharing rules will not take effect until an administrator is selected.</P>

Actual relocation costs include, but are not limited to, such items as: Radio terminal equipment (TX and/or RX—antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; prior coordination notification under § 101.103(d) of this chapter; site lease renegotiation; required antenna upgrades for interference control; power plant upgrade (if required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport equipment; and leased facilities. C also includes voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent's independent third party appraisal of its compensable relocation costs and incumbent transaction expenses that are directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the “hard” costs involved. C may not exceed $250,000 per link, with an additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower is required.</P>

                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Registration of reimbursement rights.</E> (1) To obtain reimbursement, a PCS relocator must submit documentation of the relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within ten business days of the date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent.</P>

                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation of expenses.</E> Once relocation occurs, the PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items listed in § 24.243(b). The voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must also submit an independent third party appraisal of its compensable relocation costs. The appraisal should be based on the actual cost of replacing the incumbent's system with comparable facilities and should exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades or items outside the scope of § 24.243(b). The PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must identify the particular link associated with appropriate expenses (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, costs may not be averaged over numerous links). If a PCS relocator pays a microwave incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities, the PCS relocator must estimate the costs associated with relocating the incumbent by itemizing the anticipated cost for items listed in § 24.243(b). If the sum paid to the incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining amount is not eligible for reimbursement. A PCS relocator may submit receipts or other documentation to the clearinghouse for all relocation expenses incurred since April 5, 1995.</P>

                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Licensed PCS</E>. The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine if a PCS entity preparing to initiate operations must pay a PCS relocator or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent in accordance with the formula detailed in § 24.243:</P>

                        <P>(1) When a county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed allocation, and UTAM invokes a Zone 1 power cap as a result of third party relocation activities; or</P>
                        <P>(2) A county is cleared of microwave links in the unlicensed allocation and UTAM reclassifies a Zone 2 county to Zone 1 status.</P>
                        <P>(c) Any new entrants granted licenses for the 1910-1915 MHz band must reimburse UTAM a pro rata share of its total expenses incurred by UTAM as of the date that the new entrants gain access to the band. The percent required by new entrants to pay shall be calculated based upon the amount of spectrum granted to the new entrant as compared to the total amount of spectrum UTAM is responsible for clearing of incumbents (20 megahertz), and must be paid before a new entrant begins operations in the band. For example, if a new entrant obtains a license for 5 megahertz of spectrum in this band, it is required to reimburse UTAM one-quarter of UTAM's total costs to date on a pro rata shared basis. New entrants will be responsible for the actual costs associated with future relocation activities in their licensed spectrum, but will be entitled to seek reimbursement from UTAM for the proportion of those band clearing costs that benefit users of the 1915-1930 MHz band.</P>

The clearinghouse will determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and notify the PCS entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. When the PCS entity receives a written copy of such obligation, it must pay directly to the PCS relocator or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent the amount owed within thirty days, with the exception of those businesses that qualify for installment payments. A business that qualifies for an installment payment plan must make its first installment payment within thirty days of notice from the clearinghouse. UTAM's first payment will be due thirty days after its reimbursement obligation is triggered, as described in § 24.247(b).</P>

                      <P>The new Rules adopted in Part 24 stipulate that estimates of interference to fixed microwave operations from a PCS operation will be based on the sum of signals received at a microwave receiver from the PCS operation. This appendix describes a procedure for computing this PCS level.</P>
                      <P>In general, the procedure involves four steps:</P>

                      <P>1. Determine the geographical coordinates of all microwave receivers operating on co-channel and adjacent frequencies within the coordination distance of each base station and the characteristics of each receiver, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> adjacent channel susceptibility, antenna gain, pattern and height, and line and other losses.</P>
                      <P>2. Determine an equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) for each base station and equivalent e.i.r.p. values for the mobiles and portables associated with each base station. Determine the values of pertinent correction and weighting factors based on building heights and density and distribution of portables. Close-in situations, prominent hills, and extra tall buildings require special treatment.</P>
                      <P>3. Based on PCS e.i.r.p. values, correction and weighting factors, and microwave receiving system characteristics determined above, calculate the total interference power at the input of each microwave receiver, using the Longley-Rice propagation model.</P>
                      <P>4. Based on the interference power level computed in step 3, determine interference to each microwave receiver using criteria described in Part 24 and EIA/TIA Bulletin 10-F.</P>

                      <P>The interference from each base station and the mobiles and portables associated with it is calculated as follows:

                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Base Stations.</E> Interference from each base station to each microwave should normally be considered independently. A group of base stations having more or less (within ±50 percent) the same height above average terrain, the same e.i.r.p., basically the same path to a microwave receiving site, and subtending an angle to that receiving site of less than 5 degrees, may be treated as a group, using the total power of the group and the average antenna height of the group to calculate path loss, L.</P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Mobile Stations.</E> The e.i.r.p. from mobile transmitters is weighted according to the number of base station channels expected to be devoted to mobile operation at any given time. The antenna height of mobiles used in calculating path loss, L, is assumed to be 2 meters.</P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Portable Stations.</E> The e.i.r.p. from the portable units associated with each base station is weighted according to the estimated portion of portables associated with that cell expected to be operated inside buildings at any given time and the portion which could be expected to be operating from elevated locations, such as balconies or building rooftops. For example, in the case of service intended for business use in an urban area, one might expect that perhaps 85 percent of the portables in use at any given time would be operating from within buildings and perhaps 5 percent might be operating from rooftops or balconies. The remaining 10 percent would be outside at street level.</P>
                      <P>Calculation of an equivalent e.i.r.p. for cells in suburban areas will involve different weighting criteria.</P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Urban Correction Factor.</E> The urban correction factor (UC) depends on the height and density of buildings surrounding a base station. For the core area of large cities, it is assumed to be 35 dB. For medium size cities and fringe areas of large cities (4- to 6-story buildings with scattered taller buildings and lower buildings and open spaces) it is assumed to be 25 dB; for small cities and towns, 15 dB, and for suburban residential areas (one- and two-story, single family houses with scattered multiple-story apartment buildings, shopping centers and open areas), 10 dB.</P>

                      <P>The unadjusted urban correction factor, UC, should not be applied to base station antenna heights that are greater than 50 percent of the average building height for a cell.<PRTPAGE P="142"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Building Height and Building Penetration Factors.</E> The building height correction, BH, is a function of the average building height within the nominal coverage area of the base station. It is used in conjunction with the building penetration loss, BP, to adjust the expected interference contribution from that portion of the portables transmitting from within buildings. The adjustment is given by:
                      </P>
                      <FP SOURCE="FP-1">BP=20 dB in urban areas</FP>
                      <FP SOURCE="FP-1">BP=10 dB in suburban areas</FP>
                      <FP SOURCE="FP-1">BH=2.5×(nf-1) dB</FP>
                      
                      <FP>where nf is the average height (number of floors) of the buildings in the area.</FP>
                      <P>(Note that this formula implies a net gain when the average building height is greater than 8 floors). All buildings more than twice the average height should be considered individually. The contribution to BH from that portion of portables in the building above the average building height should be increased by a factor of 20Log(h) dB, where h is the height of the portables above the average building height in meters.</P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Channel Discrimination Factor.</E> A factor based on the interference selectivity of the microwave receiver.</P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Propagation Model.</E> The PCS to microwave path loss, L, is calculated using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2., in the point-to-point mode. The Longley-Rice [1] model was derived from NBS Technical Note 101 [2], and updated in 1982 by Hufford [3]. Version 1.2.2 incorporated modifications described in a letter by Hufford [4] in 1985. Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the U.S. Geological Survey 3-second digitized terrain database.</P>
                      <P>
                        <E T="03">Special Situations.</E> If a cell size is large compared to the distance between the cell and a microwave receiving site so that it subtends an angle greater than 5 degrees, the cell should be subdivided and calculations should be based on the expected distribution of mobiles and portables within each subdivision.</P>
                      <P>If terrain elevations within a cell differ by more than a factor of two-to-one, the cell should be subdivided and microwave interference calculations should be based on the average terrain elevation for each subdivision.</P>
                      <P>If a co-channel PCS base station lies within the main beam of a microwave antenna (±5 degrees), there is no intervening terrain obstructions, and the power at the microwave receiver from that base station, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less below the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss calculations based on terrain and building losses.</P>
                      <P>If any part of a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main beam of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain obstructions, and the accumulative power of 5 percent or less of the mobiles, assuming free space propagation would be 3 dB or less below the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss calculations based on terrain and building losses.</P>
                      <P>If a building within a cell or cell subdivision lies within the main beam of a co-channel microwave antenna, there is no intervening terrain obstructions, and the cumulative power of 5 percent or fewer of the portables, assuming free space propagation, would be 3 dB or less below the interference threshold, interference will be assumed to exist unless the PCS licensee can demonstrate otherwise by specific path loss calculations based on terrain and building losses.</P>

                      <P>(3) Broadband PCS licensees that acquired C or F block licenses in closed bidding subject to the eligibility requirements of § 24.709 may partition their licensed geographic service area or disaggregate their licensed spectrum at any time to an entity that meets the eligibility criteria set forth in § 24.709 at the time the request for partial assignment of license is filed or to an entity that holds license(s) for frequency blocks C and F that met the eligibility criteria set forth in § 24.709 at the time of receipt of such license(s). Partial assignment applications seeking partitioning or disaggregation of broadband PCS licenses in spectrum blocks C and F must include an attachment demonstrating compliance with this section.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Partitioning.</E> In the case of partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).</P>

                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Installment payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Apportioning the balance on installment payment plans.</E> When a winning bidder elects to pay for its license through an installment payment plan pursuant to §§ 1.2110(g) of this chapter or 24.716, and partitions its licensed area or disaggregates spectrum to another party, the outstanding balance owed by the licensee on its installment payment plan (including accrued and unpaid interest) shall be apportioned between the licensee and partitionee or disaggregatee. Both parties will be responsible for paying their proportionate share of the outstanding balance to the U.S. Treasury. In the case of partitioning, the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the population of the partitioned area to the population of the entire original license area calculated based upon the most recent census data. In the case of disaggregation, the balance shall be apportioned based upon the ratio of the amount of spectrum disaggregated to the amount of spectrum allocated to the licensed area.</P>

                      <P>(ii) The partitionee or disaggregatee shall, as a condition of the approval of the partial assignment application, pay its entire pro rata amount within 30 days of Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will result in a rescission of the grant of the partial assignment application.</P>

                      <P>(iii) The licensee shall be permitted to continue to pay its pro rata share of the outstanding balance and shall receive new financing documents (promissory note, security agreement) with a revised payment obligation, based on the remaining amount of time on the original installment payment schedule. These financing documents will replace the licensee's existing financing documents, which shall be marked “superseded” and returned to the licensee upon receipt of the new financing documents. The original interest rate, established pursuant to § 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to the licensee's <PRTPAGE P="152"/>portion of the remaining government obligation. The Commission will require, as a further condition to approval of the partial assignment application, that the licensee execute and return to the U.S. Treasury the new financing documents within 30 days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure to meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application.</P>
                      <P>(iv) A default on the licensee's payment obligation will only affect the licensee's portion of the market.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Parties qualified for installment payment plans.</E> (i) Where both parties to a partitioning or disaggregation agreement qualify for installment payments, the partitionee or disaggregatee will be permitted to make installment payments on its portion of the remaining government obligations, as calculated according to § 24.714(c)(1).</P>
                      <P>(ii) Each party will be required, as a condition to approval of the partial assignment application, to execute separate financing documents (promissory note, security agreement) agreeing to pay their pro rata portion of the balance due (including accrued and unpaid interest) based upon the installment payment terms for which they qualify under the rules. The financing documents must be returned to the U.S. Treasury within thirty (30) days of the Public Notice conditionally granting the partial assignment application. Failure by either party to meet this condition will result in the automatic cancellation of the grant of the partial assignment application. The interest rate, established pursuant to § 1.2110(g)(3)(i) of this chapter at the time of the grant of the initial license in the market, shall continue to be applied to both parties' portion of the balance due. Each party will receive a license for their portion of the partitioned market or disaggregated spectrum.</P>
                      <P>(iii) A default on an obligation will only affect that portion of the market area held by the defaulting party.</P>
                      <P>(iv) Partitionees and disaggregatees that qualify for installment payment plans may elect to pay some of their pro rata portion of the balance due in a lump sum payment to the U.S. Treasury and to pay the remaining portion of the balance due pursuant to an installment payment plan.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">License term.</E> The license term for a partitioned license area and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original licensee's license term as provided for in § 24.15.</P>

                      <P>(i) The partitionee may certify that it will satisfy the applicable construction requirements set forth in § 24.203 for the partitioned license area; or</P>
                      <P>(ii) The original licensee may certify that it has or will meet its five-year construction requirement and will meet the ten-year construction requirement, as set forth in § 24.203, for the entire license area. In that case, the partitionee must only satisfy the requirements for “substantial service,” as set forth in § 24.16(a), for the partitioned license area by the end of the original ten-year license term of the licensee.</P>
                      <P>(iii) Applications requesting partial assignments of license for partitioning must include a certification by each party as to which of the above construction options they select.</P>
                      <P>(iv) Partitionees must submit supporting documents showing compliance with the respective construction requirements within the appropriate five- and ten-year construction benchmarks set forth in § 24.203.</P>
                      <P>(v) Failure by any partitionee to meet its respective construction requirements will result in the automatic cancellation of the partitioned or disaggregated license without further Commission action.</P>

Parties may agree to share responsibility for <PRTPAGE P="153"/>meeting the construction requirements. Parties that accept responsibility for meeting the construction requirements and later fail to do so will be subject to license forfeiture without further Commission action.</P>

                      <P>(3) Over which no person other than the management and members of the board of directors or other governing body of such publicly traded corporation, in their capacities as such, has <E T="03">de facto</E> control.</P>

                      <P>(3) For purposes of § 24.709(b)(1)(v)(A)(3) and (b)(1)(vi)(A)(3), a qualifying investor is a person who is (or holds an interest in) a member of the applicant's (or licensee's) control group and whose gross revenues and total assets do not exceed the gross revenues and total assets limits specified in § 24.709(a).</P>

                      <P>Any parties sharing a common non-controlling ownership interest who aggregate more PCS spectrum among them than a single entity is entitled to hold (<E T="03">See</E> §§ 20.6(e), 24.710, 24.204, 24.229(c) of this chapter) will be permitted to divest sufficient properties within 90 days of the license grant to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation limits as follows:</P>

                      <P>(a) The broadband PCS applicant shall submit a signed statement with its long-form application stating that <PRTPAGE P="157"/>sufficient properties will be divested within 90 days of the license grant. If the licensee is otherwise qualified, the Commission will grant the applications subject to a condition that the licensee come into compliance with the PCS spectrum aggregation limits within 90 days of grant.</P>
                      <P>(b) Within 90 days of license grant, the licensee must certify that the applicant and all parties to the application have come into compliance with the PCS spectrum aggregation limits. If the licensee fails to submit the certification within 90 days, the Commission will immediately cancel all broadband PCS licenses won by the applicant, impose the default penalty and, based on the facts presented, take any other action it may deem appropriate. Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not been secured in the required time frame, as long as the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the trustee may dispose of the property as it sees fit. In no event may the trustee retain the property for longer than six months from grant of license.</P>

                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Communications common carrier</E>. The term “communications common carrier” as used in this part means any person (individual, partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, corporation, or other entity) engaged as a common carrier for hire, in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio or in interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy, including such carriers as are described in subsection 2(b) (2) and (3) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and, in addition, for purposes of subpart H of this part, includes any individual, partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, corporation, or other entity which owns or controls, directly or indirectly, or is under direct or indirect common control with, any such carrier.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Authorized carrier.</E> The term “authorized carrier” means a communications common carrier which is authorized by the Federal Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to provide services by means of communications satellites.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Communications satellite corporation.</E> (1) The terms “communications satellite corporation” or “corporation” as used in this part mean the corporation created pursuant to the provisions of Title III of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962.</P>
                      <P>(2) The corporation shall be deemed to be a common carrier within the meaning of section 3(10) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Communication-satellite earth station complex.</E> The term communication-satellite earth station complex includes transmitters, receivers, and communications antennas at the earth station site together with the interconnecting terrestrial facilities (cables, lines, or microwave facilities) and modulating and demodulating equipment necessary for processing of traffic received from the terrestrial distribution system(s) prior to transmission via satellite and of traffic received from the satellite prior to transfer of channels of communication to terrestrial distribution system(s).<PRTPAGE P="161"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Communication-satellite earth station complex functions.</E> The communication-satellite earth station complex interconnects with terminal equipment of common carriers or authorized entities at the interface; accepts traffic from such entities at the interface, processes for transmission via satellite and performs the transmission function; receives traffic from a satellite or satellites, processes it in a form necessary to deliver channels of communication to terrestrial common carriers or such other authorized entities and delivers the processed traffic to such entities at the interface.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Interface.</E> The point of interconnection between two distinct but adjacent communications systems having different functions. The interface in the communication-satellite service is that point where communications terminal equipment of the terrestrial common carriers or other authorized entities interconnects with the terminal equipment of the communication-satellite earth station complex. The interface in the communication-satellite service shall be located at the earth station site, or if this is impracticable, as close thereto as possible.</P>
                      <P>(g) <E T="03">Emergency call center (ECC).</E> A facility that subscribers of satellite commercial mobile radio services call when in need of emergency assistance by dialing “911” on their mobile satellite earth terminal.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Preemption of local zoning of earth stations.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar regulation that materially limits transmission or reception by satellite earth station antennas, or imposes more than minimal costs on users of such antennas, is preempted unless the promulgating authority can demonstrate that such regulation is reasonable, except that nonfederal regulation of radio frequency emissions is not preempted by this section. For purposes of this paragraph (a), reasonable means that the local regulation:</P>
                      <P>(1) Has a clearly defined health, safety, or aesthetic objective that is stated in the text of the regulation itself; and</P>
                      <P>(2) Furthers the stated health, safety or aesthetic objective without unnecessarily burdening the federal interests in ensuring access to satellite services and in promoting fair and effective competition among competing communications service providers.</P>
                      <P>(b)(1) Any state or local zoning, land-use, building, or similar regulation that affects the installation, maintenance, or use of a satellite earth station antenna that is two meters or less in diameter and is located or proposed to be located in any area where commercial or industrial uses are generally permitted by non-federal land-use regulation shall be presumed unreasonable and is therefore preempted subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No civil, criminal, administrative, or other legal action of any kind shall be taken to enforce any regulation covered by this presumption unless the promulgating authority has obtained a waiver from the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or a final declaration from the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction that the presumption has been rebutted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(2) Any presumption arising from paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be rebutted upon a showing that the regulation in question:</P>
                      <P>(i) Is necessary to accomplish a clearly defined health or safety objective that is stated in the text of the regulation itself;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Is no more burdensome to satellite users than is necessary to achieve the health or safety objective; and</P>
                      <P>(iii) Is specifically applicable on its face to antennas of the class described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

                      <P>(c) Any person aggrieved by the application or potential application of a state or local zoning or other regulation in violation of paragraph (a) of this section may, after exhausting all nonfederal administrative remedies, file a petition with the Commission requesting a declaration that the state or <PRTPAGE P="162"/>local regulation in question is preempted by this section. Nonfederal administrative remedies, which do not include judicial appeals of administrative determinations, shall be deemed exhausted when:</P>
                      <P>(1) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization required by the state or local authority has been denied and any administrative appeal and variance procedure has been exhausted;</P>
                      <P>(2) The petitioner's application for a permit or other authorization required by the state or local authority has been on file for ninety days without final action;</P>
                      <P>(3) The petitioner has received a permit or other authorization required by the state or local authority that is conditioned upon the petitioner's expenditure of a sum of money, including costs required to screen, pole-mount, or otherwise specially install the antenna, greater than the aggregate purchase or total lease cost of the equipment as normally installed; or</P>
                      <P>(4) A state or local authority has notified the petitioner of impending civil or criminal action in a court of law and there are no more nonfederal administrative steps to be taken.</P>
                      <P>(d) Procedures regarding filing of petitions requesting declaratory rulings and other related pleadings will be set forth in subsequent Public Notices. All allegations of fact contained in petitions and related pleadings must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.</P>
                      <P>(e) Any state or local authority that wishes to maintain and enforce zoning or other regulations inconsistent with this section may apply to the Commission for a full or partial waiver of this section. Such waivers may be granted by the Commission in its sole discretion, upon a showing by the applicant that local concerns of a highly specialized or unusual nature create a necessity for regulation inconsistent with this section. No application for waiver shall be considered unless it specifically sets forth the particular regulation for which waiver is sought. Waivers granted in accordance with this section shall not apply to later-enacted or amended regulations by the local authority unless the Commission expressly orders otherwise.</P>
                      <P>(f) A satellite earth station antenna that is designed to receive direct broadcast satellite service, including direct-to-home satellite services, that is one meter or less in diameter or is located in Alaska is covered by the regulations in § 1.4000 of this chapter.</P>

                        <P>(c) <E T="03">FAA notification.</E> Before the construction of new antenna structures or alteration in the height of existing antenna structures is authorized by the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determination of “no hazard” may be required. To apply for this determination, the FAA must be notified of the planned construction. Criteria used to determine whether FAA notification is required for a particular antenna structure are contained in part 17 of this chapter. Applications proposing construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing antenna structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or alteration is <E T="03">not</E> required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate such and, unless the reason is obvious (<E T="03">e.g.</E> structure height is less than 6.10 meters AGL) must contain a statement explaining why FAA notification is not required.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Painting and lighting.</E> The owner of each antenna structure required to be painted and/or illuminated under the provisions of Section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall operate and maintain the antenna structure painting and lighting in accordance with part 17 of this chapter. In the event of default by the owner, each licensee or permittee shall be individually responsible for conforming to the requirements pertaining to antenna structure painting and lighting.</P>
                        <P>(e) <E T="03">Antenna Structure Registration Number.</E> Applications proposing construction of one or more new antenna structures or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number(s) for the affected structure(s). If no such number has been assigned at the time the application is filed, the applicant must state in the application whether or not the antenna structure owner has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in accordance with part 17 of this chapter for the antenna structure in question.</P>
                        <P>(f) Construction permits are not required for U.S.-licensed space stations. Construction of such stations may commence, at the applicant's own risk, prior to grant of a license. Prior to commencing construction, however, applicants must notify the Commission in writing they plan to begin construction at their own risk.</P>

                        <P>(g) Except as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section, a launch authorization and station license (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, operating <PRTPAGE P="165"/>authority) must be applied for and granted before a space station may be launched and operated in orbit. Request for launch authorization may be included in an application for space station license. However, an application for authority to launch and operate an on-ground spare satellite will be considered pursuant to the following procedures:</P>
                        <P>(1) Applications for launch and operation of an on-ground spare NGSO-like satellite will be considered pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 25.157, except as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(2) Applications for launch and operation of an on-ground spare GSO-like satellite will be considered pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 25.158, except as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(3) Neither paragraph (g)(1) nor (g)(2) of this section will apply in cases where the space station to be launched is determined to be an emergency replacement for a previously authorized space station that has been lost as a result of a launch failure or a catastrophic in-orbit failure.</P>
                        <P>(h) Licensees of Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) satellite systems need not file separate applications to operate technically identical in-orbit spares authorized as part of a blanket license pursuant to § 25.114(e) or any other satellite blanket licensing provision in this part. However, the licensee shall notify the Commission within 30 days of bringing the in-orbit spare into operation, and certify that operation of this space station did not cause the licensee to exceed the total number of operating space stations authorized by the Commission, and that the licensee will operate the space station within the applicable terms and conditions of its license. These notifications must be filed electronically on FCC Form 312.</P>

                        <P>(13) For satellite applications in the Direct Broadcast Satellite service, if the proposed system's technical characteristics differ from those specified in the Appendix 30 BSS Plans, the Appendix 30A feeder link Plans, Annex 5 to Appendix 30 or Annex 3 to Appendix 30A, each applicant shall provide:</P>
                        <P>(i) The information requested in Appendix 4 of the ITU's Radio Regulations. Further, applicants shall provide sufficient technical showing that the proposed system could operate satisfactorily if all assignments in the BSS and feeder link Plans were implemented.</P>

                        <P>(i) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the amount of debris released in a planned manner during normal operations, and has assessed and limited the probability of the space station becoming a source of debris by collisions with small debris or meteoroids that could cause loss of control and prevent post-mission disposal;</P>

                        <P>(ii) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability of accidental explosions during and after completion of mission operations. This statement must include a demonstration that debris generation will not result from the conversion of energy sources on board the spacecraft into energy that fragments the spacecraft. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy. This demonstration should address whether stored energy will be removed at the spacecraft's end of life, by depleting residual fuel and leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any remaining source of stored energy, or through other equivalent procedures specifically disclosed in the application;<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
                        </P>

                        <P>(iii) A statement that the space station operator has assessed and limited the probability of the space station becoming a source of debris by collisions with large debris or other operational space stations. Where a space station will be launched into a low-Earth orbit that is identical, or very similar, to an orbit used by other space stations, the statement must include an analysis of the potential risk of collision and a description of what measures the space station operator plans to take to avoid in-orbit collisions. If the space station operator is relying on coordination with another system, the statement must indicate what steps have been taken to contact, and ascertain the likelihood of successful coordination of physical operations with, the other system. The statement must disclose the accuracy—if any—with which orbital parameters of non-geostationary satellite orbit space stations will be maintained, including apogee, perigee, inclination, and the right ascension of the ascending node(s). In the event that a system is not able to maintain orbital tolerances, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, it lacks a propulsion system for orbital maintenance, that fact should be included in the debris mitigation disclosure. Such systems must also indicate the anticipated evolution over time of the orbit of the proposed satellite or satellites. Where a space station requests the assignment of a geostationary-Earth orbit location, it must assess whether there are any known satellites located at, or reasonably expected to be located at, the requested orbital location, or assigned in the vicinity of that location, such that the station keeping volumes of the respective satellites might overlap. If so, the statement must include a statement as to the identities of those parties and the measures that will be taken to prevent collisions;</P>
                        <P>(iv) A statement detailing the post-mission disposal plans for the space station at end of life, including the quantity of fuel—if any—that will be reserved for post-mission disposal maneuvers. For geostationary-Earth orbit space stations, the statement must disclose the altitude selected for a post-mission disposal orbit and the calculations that are used in deriving the disposal altitude. The statement must also include a casualty risk assessment if planned post-mission disposal involves atmospheric re-entry of the space station. In general, an assessment should include an estimate as to whether portions of the spacecraft will survive re-entry and reach the surface of the Earth, as well as an estimate of the resulting probability of human casualty.</P>
                        <P>(15) Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite service shall include the following information as an attachment to its application:</P>
                        <P>(i) Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(15)(ii) of this section, an applicant proposing to operate in the 17.3-17.7 GHz frequency band, must provide a demonstration that the proposed space station will comply with the power flux density limits set forth in § 25.208(w) of this part.</P>
                        <P>(ii) In cases where the proposed space station will not comply with the power flux density limits set forth in § 25.208(w) of this part, the applicant will be required to provide a certification that all potentially affected parties acknowledge and do not object to the use of the applicant's higher power flux densities. The affected parties with whom the applicant must coordinate are those GSO 17/24 GHz BSS satellite networks located up to ±6° away for excesses of up to 3 dB above the power flux-density levels specified in § 25.208(w) of this part, and up to ±10° away greater for excesses greater than 3 dB above those levels.</P>
                        <P>(iii) An applicant proposing to provide international service in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band must demonstrate that it will meet the power flux density limits set forth in § 25.208(c) of this part.</P>

                        <P>(17) An applicant seeking to operate a space station in the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite service pursuant to the provisions of § 25.262(b) of this part, at an offset location no greater than one degree offset from an orbital location specified in Appendix F of the Report and Order adopted May 2, 2007, IB Docket No. 06-123, FCC 07-76, must submit a written request to that effect as part of the narrative portion of its application.</P>
                        <P>(18) For space stations in the Direct Broadcast Satellite service or the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite service, maximum orbital eccentricity.</P>
                        <P>(e) Applicants requesting authority to launch and operate a system comprised of technically identical, non-geostationary satellite orbit space stations may file a single “blanket” application containing the information specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for each representative space station.</P>

                        <P>(a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of facilities, request may be made for special temporary authority to install and/or operate new or modified equipment. The request must contain the full particulars of the proposed operation including all facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the public interest therein. No request for temporary authority will be considered unless it is received by the Commission at least 3 working days prior to the date of proposed construction or operation or, where an extension is sought, the expiration date of the existing temporary authorization. A request received within less than 3 working days may be accepted only upon due showing of extraordinary reasons for the delay in submitting the request which could not have been earlier foreseen by the applicant. A copy of the request for special temporary authority also shall be forwarded to the Commission's Columbia Operations Center, 9200 Farm House Lane, Columbia, MD 21046-1609.</P>
                        <P>(b)(1) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization only upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary operations in the public interest and that delay in the institution of these temporary operations would seriously prejudice the public interest. Convenience to the applicant, such as marketing considerations or meeting scheduled customer in-service dates, will not be deemed sufficient for this purpose.</P>
                        <P>(2) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period not to exceed 180 days, with additional periods not exceeding 180 days, if the Commission has placed the special temporary authority (STA) request on public notice.</P>
                        <P>(3) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period not to exceed 60 days, if the STA request has not been placed on public notice, and the applicant plans to file a request for regular authority for the service.</P>
                        <P>(4) The Commission may grant a temporary authorization for a period not to exceed 30 days, if the STA request has not been placed on public notice, and an application for regular authority is not contemplated.</P>

                        <P>(c) Each application proposing construction of one or more earth station antennas or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing earth station antenna structures, where FAA notification prior to such construction or alteration is required by part 17 of this chapter, must include the FCC Antenna Structure Registration Number(s) for the affected satellite earth station antenna(s). If no such number has been assigned at the time the application(s) is filed, the applicant must state in the application whether the satellite earth station antenna owner has notified the FAA of the proposed construction or alteration and applied to the FCC for an Antenna Structure Registration Number in accordance with part 17 of this chapter. Applications proposing construction of one or more earth station antennas or alteration of the overall height of one or more existing earth station antennas, where FAA notification prior to such construction or alteration is <E T="03">not</E> required by part 17 of this chapter, must indicate such and, unless the satellite earth station antenna is 6.10 meters or less above ground level (AGL), must contain a statement explaining why FAA notification is not required.</P>

The Federal use of frequencies in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service frequency bands is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</P>
                        <P>(ii) The Commission will use its existing procedures for liaison with NTIA to reach agreement with respect to achieving compatible operations between Federal government users under the jurisdiction of NTIA and non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems (including user transceivers subject to blanket licensing under § 25.115(d)) through the frequency assignment and coordination practices established by NTIA and the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). In order to facilitate such frequency assignment and coordination, applicants shall provide the Commission with sufficient information to evaluate electromagnetic compatibility with the Federal government use of the spectrum, and any additional information requested by the Commission. As part of the coordination process, applicants shall show that they will not cause unacceptable interference to authorized Federal government users, based upon existing system information provided by the Government. The frequency assignment and coordination of the satellite system with Federal government users shall be completed prior to grant of construction authorization.</P>
                        <P>(iii) The Commission shall also coordinate with NTIA/IRAC with regard to the frequencies to be shared by those earth stations of non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems that are not subject to blanket licensing under § 25.115(d), and authorized Federal government stations in the fixed and mobile services, through the exchange of appropriate systems information.</P>

                        <P>(3) Coordination among non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems. Applicants for authority to establish non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems are encouraged to coordinate their proposed frequency usage with existing permittees and licensees in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service whose facilities could be affected by the new proposal in terms of frequency interference or restricted system capacity. All affected applicants, permittees, and licensees shall, at the direction of the Commission, cooperate fully and make every reasonable effort to resolve technical problems and conflicts that may inhibit effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, the permittee <PRTPAGE P="194"/>or licensee being coordinated with is not obligated to suggest changes or re-engineer an applicant's proposal in cases involving conflicts.</P>
                        <P>(4) Safety and distress communications. Stations operating in the non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service that are used to comply with any statutory or regulatory equipment carriage requirements may also be subject to the provisions of sections 321(b) and 359 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Licensees are advised that these provisions give priority to radio communications or signals relating to ships in distress and prohibit a charge for the transmission of maritime distress calls and related traffic.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> All operators of non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service systems shall, on June 30 of each year, file a report with the International Bureau and the Commission's Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, containing the following information current as of May 31st of that year:</P>

These test points are based on information from U.S.-licensed geostationary satellite orbit fixed-satellite service and broadcast satellite service operators in the bands 10.7 GHz to 14.5 GHz. Each U.S.-licensed geostationary satellite orbit fixed satellite service and broadcast satellite service operator in the bands 10.7 GHz to 14.5 GHz may submit up to 10 test points for this section containing the latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, elevation angle, antenna size, efficiency to be used by non-geostationary satellite orbit fixed-satellite service licensees in the bands 10.7 GHz to 14.5 GHz during the upcoming year.</P>

                        <P>(2) Operational equivalent power flux-density, space-to-Earth direction, (operational EPFD<E T="52">down</E>) limits. Using the information contained in (b)(1) of this section plus the measured space station antenna patterns, provide the result of the execution of the computer simulation for the anticipated in-line operational EPFD<E T="52">down</E> levels for each of the submitted test points provided by the Commission.

                        <P>(a) <E T="03">License terms.</E> License terms for DBS facilities are specified in § 25.121(a).</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Due diligence.</E> (1) All persons granted DBS authorizations shall proceed with due diligence in constructing DBS systems. Permittees shall be required to complete contracting for construction of the satellite station(s) within one year of the grant of the authorization. The satellite stations shall also be required to be in operation within six years of the authorization grant.</P>
                        <P>(2) In addition to the requirements stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, all persons who receive new or additional DBS authorizations after January 19, 1996 shall complete construction of the first satellite in their respective DBS systems within four years of grant of the authorization. All satellite stations in such a DBS system shall be in operation within six years of the grant of the authorization.</P>

                        <P>(3) DBS licensees shall be required to proceed consistent with all applicable due diligence obligations, unless otherwise determined by the Commission upon proper showing in any particular case. Transfer of control of the authorization shall not be considered to justify extension of these deadlines.<PRTPAGE P="206"/>

                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Geographic service requirements.</E> Those entities acquiring DBS authorizations after January 19, 1996, or who after January 19, 1996 modify a previous DBS authorization to launch a replacement satellite, must provide DBS service to Alaska and Hawaii where such service is technically feasible from the authorized orbital location. This requirement does not apply to DBS satellites authorized to operate at the 61.5° W.L. orbital location. DBS applicants seeking to operate from locations other than 61.5° W.L. who do not provide service to Alaska and Hawaii, must provide technical analyses to the Commission demonstrating that such service is not feasible as a technical matter, or that while technically feasible such services would require so many compromises in satellite design and operation as to make it economically unreasonable.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">DBS subject to competitive bidding.</E> Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide DBS are subject to competitive bidding procedures. The general competitive bidding procedures set forth in part 1, subpart Q of this chapter will apply unless otherwise provided in this part.</P>
                        <P>(e) <E T="03">DBS long form application.</E> Winning bidders are subject to the provisions of § 1.2107 of this chapter except that in lieu of a FCC Form 601 each winning bidder shall submit the long-form satellite service application (FCC Form 312) within thirty (30) days after being notified by Public Notice that it is the winning bidder. Each winning bidder will also be required to submit by the same deadline the information described in § 25.215 (Technical) and § 25.601 (EEO), and in paragraph (f) of this section. Each winner also will be required to file, by the same deadline, a signed statement describing its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with any applicable spectrum limitations, if it is not already in compliance. Such information shall be submitted pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 25.114 and any associated Public Notices.</P>
                        <P>(f) <E T="03">Technical qualifications.</E> DBS operations must be in accordance with the sharing criteria and technical characteristics contained in Appendices 30 and 30A of the ITU's Radio Regulations. Operation of systems using differing technical characteristics may be permitted, with adequate technical showing, and if a request has been made to the ITU to modify the appropriate Plans to include the system's technical parameters.</P>

                        <P>(a) Petitions to deny, petitions for other forms of relief, and other objections or comments must:</P>
                        <P>(1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's name, station location, Commission file numbers, and radio service involved) with which it is concerned;</P>
                        <P>(2) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of the application or major amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing deadline);</P>
                        <P>(3) Filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, periods and other applicable provisions of §§ 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter, except that such petitions must be filed electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter;</P>
                        <P>(4) Contain specific allegations of fact (except for those of which official notice may be taken) to support the specific relief requested, which shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party of interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding, the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest; and</P>
                        <P>(5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed to the applicant no later than the date the pleading is filed with the Commission.</P>
                        <P>(b) The Commission will classify as informal objections:</P>
                        <P>(1) Any pleading not filed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
                        <P>(2) Any pleading to which the thirty (30) day public notice period of § 25.151 does not apply; or</P>
                        <P>(3) Any objections to the grant of an application when the objections do not conform to either paragraph (a) of this section or to other Commission rules and requirements.</P>

                        <P>(c) Except for opposition to petitions to deny an application filed pursuant <PRTPAGE P="211"/>to § 25.220, oppositions to petitions to deny an application or responses to comments and informal objections regarding an application may be filed within 10 days after the petition, comment, or objection is filed and must be in accordance with other applicable provisions of §§ 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter, except that such oppositions must be filed electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(d) Except for opposition to petitions to deny an application filed pursuant to § 25.220, reply comments by the party that filed the original petition may be filed with respect to pleadings filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section within 5 days after the time for filing oppositions has expired unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing deadline and must be in accordance with other applicable provisions of §§ 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter, except that such reply comments must be filed electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(e) If a petition to deny an application filed pursuant to § 25.220 is filed, the applicant must file a statement with the Commission explaining whether the applicant has resolved all outstanding issues raised by the petitioner, within 30 days of the date the petition for deny is filed. This statement must be in accordance with the provisions of §§ 1.41 through 1.52 of this chapter applicable to oppositions to petitions to deny, except that such reply comments must be filed electronically through the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 1, subpart Y of this chapter.</P>

                        <P>(a) Applications for a radio station authorization, or for modification or renewal of an authorization, will be granted if, upon examination of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, and upon consideration of such other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the applicant is legally, technically, and otherwise qualified, that the proposed facilities and operations comply with all applicable rules, regulations, and policies, and that grant of the application will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.</P>

                        <P>(b) Whenever the Commission grants any application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions other than those routinely applied to applications of the same type, the grant shall be considered final unless the Commission should revise its action (either by granting the application as originally requested, or by designating the application for hearing) in response to a petition for reconsideration which:<PRTPAGE P="212"/>

                        <P>(3) Applications for NGSO-like satellite and GSO-like systems employing two or more service bands will be treated like separate applications for each service band, and each service band request will be considered pursuant to § 25.157 or § 25.158, as appropriate.</P>
                        <P>(4) Applications for feeder link authority or intersatellite link authority will be treated like an application separate from its associated service band. Each feeder link request or intersatellite link request will be considered pursuant to the procedure for GSO-like service or NGSO-like service, as applicable.</P>
                        <P>(5) In cases where the Commission has not adopted frequency-band specific service rules, the Commission will not consider NGSO-like applications after it has granted a GSO-like application, and it will not consider GSO-like applications after it has granted an NGSO-like application, unless and until the Commission establishes NGSO/GSO sharing criteria for that frequency band. In the event that the Commission receives NGSO-like applications and GSO-like applications at the same time, and the Commission has not adopted sharing criteria in that band, the Commission will divide the spectrum between GSO-like and NGSO-like licensees based on the proportion of qualified GSO-like and NGSO-like applicants.</P>

                        <P>(a) This section specifies the Commission's procedures for considering license applications for “NGSO-like satellite systems.” For purposes of this section, the term “NGSO-like satellite system” is defined as:</P>
                        <P>(1) All NGSO satellite systems, and</P>
                        <P>(2) All GSO MSS satellite systems, in which the satellites are designed to communicate with earth stations with omni-directional antennas.</P>
                        <P>(b) Each NGSO-like satellite system application will be reviewed to determine whether it is acceptable for filing within the meaning of § 25.112. Any application that is not acceptable for filing would be returned to the applicant.</P>

                        <P>(c) Each NGSO-like satellite system application that is acceptable for filing will be reviewed to determine whether it is a “competing application,” <E T="03">i.e.</E>, filed in response to a public notice initiating a processing round, or a “lead application,” <E T="03">i.e.</E>, all other NGSO-like satellite system applications.</P>
                        <P>(1) Competing applications that are acceptable for filing will be placed on public notice to provide interested parties an opportunity to file pleadings in response to the application pursuant to § 25.154.</P>
                        <P>(2) Lead applications that are acceptable for filing will be placed on public notice. This public notice will initiate a processing round, establish a cut-off date for competing NGSO-like satellite system applications, and provide interested parties an opportunity to file pleadings in response to the application pursuant to § 25.154.</P>

                        <P>(d) After review of each of the applications in the processing round, and all the pleadings filed in response to each application, the Commission will grant all the applications that meet the standards of § 25.156(a), and deny the other applications.<PRTPAGE P="213"/>
                        </P>
                        <P>(e)(1) In the event that there is insufficient spectrum in the frequency band available to accommodate all the qualified applicants in a processing round, the available spectrum will be divided equally among the licensees whose applications are granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(2) In cases where there are only one or two applications in a processing round granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, each applicant will be assigned 1/3 of the available spectrum, and the remaining spectrum will be made available to other licensees in an additional processing round pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(3) In cases where there are three or more applications in a processing round granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and one or more applicants apply for less spectrum than they would be warranted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, those applicants will be assigned the bandwidth amount they requested in their applications. In those cases, the remaining qualified applicants will be assigned the lesser of the amount of spectrum they requested in their applications and the amount spectrum that they would be assigned if the available spectrum were divided equally among the remaining qualified applicants.</P>
                        <P>(f)(1) Each licensee will be allowed to select the particular band segment it wishes to use no earlier than 60 days before they plan to launch the first satellite in its system, and no later than 30 days before that date, by submitting a letter to the Secretary of the Commission. The licensee shall serve copies of this letter to the other participants in the processing round pursuant to § 1.47 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(2) The licensee shall request contiguous bandwidth in both the uplink and downlink band. Each licensee's bandwidth selection in both the uplink and downlink band shall not preclude other licensees from selecting contiguous bandwidth.</P>
                        <P>(3) If two or more licensees in a processing round request the same band segment, all licensees other than the first one to request that particular band segment will be required to make another selection.</P>
                        <P>(g)(1) In the event that an applicants' license is cancelled for any reason, the Commission will redistribute the bandwidth allocated to that applicant equally among the remaining applicants whose licenses were granted concurrently with the cancelled license, unless the Commission determines that such a redistribution would not result in a sufficient number of licensees remaining to make reasonably efficient use of the frequency band.</P>
                        <P>(2) In the event that the redistribution of bandwidth set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section would not result in a sufficient number of licensees remaining to make reasonably efficient use of the frequency band, the Commission will issue a public notice initiating a processing round, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to invite parties to apply for an NGSO-like satellite system license to operate in a portion of the bandwidth made available as a result of the cancellation of the initial applicant's license. Parties already holding licenses to operate an NGSO-like satellite system in that frequency band will not be permitted to participate in that processing round.</P>
                        <P>(3) There is a presumption that three satellite licensees in a frequency band are sufficient to make reasonably efficient use of the frequency band.</P>
                        <P>(h) Services offered pursuant to an NGSO-like license in a frequency band granted before the Commission has adopted frequency-band-specific service rules for that band will be subject to the default service rules in § 25.217.</P>

                        <P>(a) This section specifies the Commission's procedures for considering license applications for “GSO-like satellite systems.” For purposes of this section, the term “GSO-like satellite system” is defined as a GSO satellite designed to communicate with earth stations with directional antennas. Examples of GSO-like satellite systems are those which use earth stations with antennas with directivity towards the satellites, such as FSS, and MSS feeder links which use GSO satellites. GSO-<PRTPAGE P="214"/>like satellite systems are satellite systems that are not NGSO-like satellite systems within the meaning of § 25.157(a).</P>
                        <P>(b) Applications for GSO-like satellite system licenses will be placed in a queue and considered in the order that they are filed, pursuant to the following procedure:</P>
                        <P>(1) The application will be reviewed to determine whether it is acceptable for filing within the meaning of § 25.112. If not, the application will be returned to the applicant.</P>
                        <P>(2) If the application is acceptable for filing, the application will be placed on public notice pursuant to § 25.151, and interested parties will be given an opportunity to file pleadings pursuant to § 25.154.</P>
                        <P>(3) The application will be granted only if it meets each of the following criteria:</P>
                        <P>(i) After review of the application and any pleadings filed in response to that application, the Commission finds that the application meets the standards of § 25.156(a); and</P>
                        <P>(ii) The proposed satellite will not cause harmful interference to any previously licensed operations.</P>
                        <P>(c) An applicant for a GSO-like satellite system license is not allowed to transfer, assign, or otherwise permit any other entity to assume its place in any queue.</P>
                        <P>(d) In the event that two or more GSO-like satellite system license applications are mutually exclusive within the meaning of § 25.155(c), the Commission will consider those applications pursuant to the following procedure:</P>
                        <P>(1) Each application will be reviewed to determine whether it is acceptable for filing within the meaning of § 25.112. Any application not found acceptable for filing will be returned to the applicant.</P>
                        <P>(2) All applications that are acceptable for filing will be placed on public notice pursuant to § 25.151, and interested parties will be given an opportunity to file pleadings pursuant to § 25.154.</P>
                        <P>(3) Each application will be granted if it meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and otherwise will be denied.</P>
                        <P>(4) In the event that two or more applications are granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the available bandwidth at the orbital location or locations in question will be divided equally among those licensees.</P>
                        <P>(5) Licensees whose licenses are granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section will be allowed to select the particular band segment it wishes to use no earlier than 60 days before they plan to launch the first satellite in its system, and no later than 30 days before that date, by submitting a letter to the Secretary of the Commission. The licensee shall serve copies of this letter to the other participants in the processing round pursuant to § 1.47 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(6) Licensees whose licenses are granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall request contiguous bandwidth in both the uplink and downlink band. Each licensee's bandwidth selection shall not preclude other licensees from selecting contiguous bandwidth.</P>
                        <P>(7) If two or more licensees whose licenses are granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section request the same band segment, all licensees other than the first one to request that particular band segment will be required to make another selection.</P>
                        <P>(e) Services offered pursuant to a GSO-like license in a frequency band granted before the Commission has adopted frequency-band-specific service rules for that band will be subject to the default service rules in § 25.217.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Limits on pending applications and unbuilt satellite systems.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) Applicants with a total of five applications for GSO-like space station licenses on file with the Commission in a particular frequency band, or a total of five licensed-but-unbuilt GSO-like space stations in a particular frequency band, or a combination of pending GSO-like applications and licensed-but-unbuilt GSO-like space stations in a particular frequency band that equals five, will not be permitted to apply for another GSO-like space station license in that frequency band.</P>

                        <P>(b) Applicants with an application for one NGSO-like satellite system license <PRTPAGE P="215"/>on file with the Commission in a particular frequency band, or one licensed-but-unbuilt NGSO-like satellite system in a particular frequency band, will not be permitted to apply for another NGSO-like satellite system license in that frequency band.</P>
                        <P>(c) If an applicant has an attributable interest in one or more other entities seeking one or more space station licenses, the pending applications and licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems filed by those other entities will be counted as filed by the applicant for purposes of the limits on the number of pending space station applications and licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems in this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph, an applicant has an “attributable interest” in another entity if:</P>
                        <P>(1) It holds equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the aggregate, exceed thirty-three (33) percent of the total asset value (defined as the aggregate of all equity plus all debt) of that entity, or</P>
                        <P>(2) It holds a controlling interest in that entity, or is the subsidiary of a party holding a controlling interest in that entity, within the meaning of 47 CFR 1.2110(b)(2).</P>

                        <P>(3) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, ownership interests shall be calculated on a fully diluted basis, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, all agreements, such as warrants, stock options, and convertible debentures, will generally be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised.</P>
                        <P>(d) In the event that a licensee misses three or more milestones within any three-year period, the Commission will presume that the licensee obtained one or more of those licenses for speculative purposes. Unless the licensee rebuts this presumption, it will not be permitted to apply for a GSO-like satellite or an NGSO-like satellite system in any frequency band if it has two or more satellite applications pending, or two licensed-but-unbuilt satellite systems of any kind. This limit will remain in effect until the licensee provides adequate information to demonstrate that it is very likely to construct its licensed facilities if it were allowed to file more applications.</P>
                        <P>(e) For purposes of this section, “frequency band” means one of the paired frequency bands available for satellite service listed in § 25.202.</P>

                      <P>(2) Advance consultation is recommended particularly for those applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether coordination is recommended:</P>
                      <P>(i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;</P>
                      <P>(iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone;</P>
                      <P>(iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of Table Mountain Receiving Zone.</P>
                      <P>(3) Applicants concerned are urged to communicate with the Radio Frequency Management Coordinator, Department of Commerce, Research Support Services, NOAA R/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; telephone (303) 497-6548, in advance of filing their applications with the Commission.</P>
                      <P>(4) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised that such consultation can avoid objections from the Department of Commerce or proceedings to modify any authorization which may be granted which, in fact, delivers a signal at the site in excess of the field strength specified herein.</P>

                      <P>(f) Notification to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory: In order to minimize possible harmful interference at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory site located at Green Bank, Pocahontas County, W. Va., and at the Naval Radio Research Observatory site at Sugar Grove, Pendleton County, W. Va. any applicant for a station authorization other than mobile, temporary base, temporary fixed, Personal Radio, Civil Air Patrol, or amateur seeking a station license for a new station, a construction permit to construct a new station or to modify an existing station license in a manner which would change either the frequency, power, antenna height or directivity, or location of such a station within the area bounded by 39°15′ N. on the north, 78°30′ W. on the east, 37°30′ N. on the south and 80°30′ W. on the west shall, at the time of filing such application with the Commission, simultaneously notify the Director, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P.O. Box No. 2, Green Bank, W. Va. 24944, in writing, of the technical particulars of the proposed station. Such notification shall include the geographical coordinates of the antenna, antenna height, antenna directivity if any, proposed frequency, type of emission, and power. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in his application to the Commission the date notification was made to the observatory. After receipt of such applications, the <PRTPAGE P="228"/>Commission will allow a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the notifications indicated. If an objection to the proposed operation is received during the 20-day period from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for itself or on behalf of the Naval Radio Research Observatory, the Commission will consider all aspects of the problem and take whatever action is deemed appropriate.</P>
                      <P>(g) Protection for Federal Communications Commission monitoring stations:</P>

                      <P>(1) Applicants in the vicinity of an FCC monitoring station for a radio station authorization to operate new transmitting facilities or changed transmitting facilities which would increase the field strength produced over the monitoring station over that previously authorized are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the possible need to protect the FCC stations from harmful interference. Geographical coordinates of the facilities which require protection are listed in § 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules. Applications for stations (except mobile stations) which will produce on any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength of <E T="03">greater than 10 mV/m</E> in the authorized bandwidth of service (−65.8 dBW/m<SU>2</SU> power flux density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120 ohms) at the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine extent of possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value and existing root-sum-square or other ambient radio field signal levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station may be added to the station authorization.</P>
                      <P>(2) In the event that calculated value of expected field exceeds 10 mV/m (−65.8 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>) at the reference coordinates, or if there is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate with: Chief, Compliance and Information Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554, Telephone (202) 632-6980.</P>
                      <P>(3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those applicants who have no reliable data which indicates whether the field strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an applicant should coordinate:</P>
                      <P>(i) All stations within 2.5 kilometers;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Stations within 5 kilometers with 50 watts or more average effective radiated power (ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;</P>
                      <P>(iii) Stations within 15 kilometers with 1 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;</P>
                      <P>(iv) Stations within 80 kilometers with 25 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station.</P>
                      <P>(4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in § 0.121(c) of the Commission's Rules and also meets the criteria outlined in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised that such consultation can avoid objections from the Federal Communications Commission or modification of any authorization which will cause harmful interference.</P>

                      <P>(h) Sites and frequencies for GSO and NGSO earth stations, operating in a frequency band where both have a co-primary allocation, shall be selected to avoid earth station antenna mainlobe-to-satellite antenna mainlobe coupling, between NGSO systems and between NGSO and GSO systems, in order to minimize the possibility of harmful interference between these services. Prior to filing an earth station application, in bands with co-primary allocations to NGSO and GSO earth stations, <PRTPAGE P="229"/>the applicant shall coordinate the proposed site and frequency usage with existing earth station licensees and with current earth station authorization applicants.</P>

                      <P>(i) Any applicant for a new permanent transmitting fixed earth station authorization to be located on the islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques, and Culebra, or for a modification of an existing authorization which would change the frequency, power, antenna height, directivity, or location of such station on these islands and would increase the likelihood of the authorized facility causing interference, shall notify the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory, HC3 Box 53995, Arecibo, Puerto Rico 00612, in writing or electronically, of the technical parameters of the proposal. Applicants may wish to consult interference guidelines, which will be provided by Cornell University. Applicants who choose to transmit information electronically should e-mail to: <E T="03">prcz@naic.edu.</E>
                      </P>
                      <P>(1) The notification to the Interference Office, Arecibo Observatory shall be made prior to, or simultaneously with, the filing of the application with the Commission. The notification shall state the geographical coordinates of the antenna (NAD-83 datum), antenna height above ground, ground elevation at the antenna, antenna directivity and gain, proposed frequency and FCC Rule Part, type of emission, effective radiated power, and whether the proposed use is itinerant. Generally, submission of the information in the technical portion of the FCC license application is adequate notification. In addition, the applicant shall indicate in its application to the Commission the date notification was made to the Arecibo Observatory.</P>
                      <P>(2) After receipt of such applications, the Commission will allow the Arecibo Observatory a period of 20 days for comments or objections in response to the notification indicated. The applicant will be required to make reasonable efforts in order to resolve or mitigate any potential interference problem with the Arecibo Observatory and to file either an amendment to the application or a modification application, as appropriate. If the Commission determines that an applicant has satisfied its responsibility to make reasonable efforts to protect the Observatory from interference, its application may be granted.</P>
                      <P>(3) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to operations that transmit on frequencies above 15 GHz.</P>
                      <P>(j) Applicants for non-geostationary 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service/ Radiodetermination satellite service feeder links in the bands 17.7-20.2 GHz and 27.5-30.0 GHz shall indicate the frequencies and spacecraft antenna gain contours towards each feeder-link earth station location and will coordinate with licensees of other fixed-satellite service and terrestrial-service systems sharing the band to determine geographic protection areas around each non-geostationary mobile-satellite service/radiodetermination satellite service feeder-link earth station.</P>
                      <P>(k) An applicant for operation of an earth station, other than an ESV or a VMES, that will operate with a geostationary satellite or non-geostationary satellite in a shared frequency band in which the non-geostationary system is (or is proposed to be) licensed for feeder links, shall demonstrate in its applications that its proposed earth station will not cause unacceptable interference to any other satellite network that is authorized to operate in the same frequency band, or certify that the operations of its earth station shall conform to established coordination agreements between the operator(s) of the space station(s) with which the earth station is to communicate and the operator(s) of any other space station licensed to use the band.</P>
                      <P>(l) Applicants for feeder link earth station facilities operating in the 25.05-25.25 GHz band may be licensed only in Economic Areas where no existing FS licensee has been authorized, and shall coordinate their operations with 24 GHz fixed service operations if the power flux density of their transmitted signal at the boundary of the fixed service license area is equal to or greater than −114 dBW/m<SU>2</SU> in any 1 MHz.</P>

                      <P>(1) When uplink adaptive power control is used, the EIRP used for calculation of the power flux density level <PRTPAGE P="230"/>should be the maximum possible, taking into account the adaptive power increase.</P>
                      <P>(2) The power flux density levels should be calculated based on the actual off-axis gain characteristics of the earth station antenna, and should assume free space propagation conditions.</P>
                      <P>(3) When determining whether the power flux density threshold limit is exceeded at the 24 GHz FS licensing boundary, a feeder link earth station applicant must take into account not only the transmissions from its own antenna(s), but also those from any previously authorized feeder link earth stations. Thus, if the cumulative power flux density level at the FS license boundary is in excess of −114 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/MHz, the earth station applicant must either modify its proposed operations such that this value is not exceeded, or enter into coordination with the affected FS licensee.</P>

The earth station operator shall not increase power until receiving notification from the satellite network control center that the frequency and <PRTPAGE P="247"/>polarization alignment are satisfactory pursuant to the procedures specified in § 25.272. The stationary earth station operator that has successfully transmitted an initial video test signal to a satellite pursuant to this paragraph is not required to make subsequent video test transmissions if subsequent transmissions are conducted using exactly the same parameters as the initial transmission.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Narrowband analog transmissions, digital transmissions, and video transmissions in the GSO Fixed-Satellite Service.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided by this part, criteria for unacceptable levels of interference caused by other satellite networks shall be established on the basis of nominal operating conditions and with the objective of minimizing orbital separations between satellites.</P>
                      <P>(b) Emissions with an occupied bandwidth of less than 2 MHz are not protected from interference from wider bandwidth transmissions if the r.f. carrier frequency of the narrowband signal is within ±1 MHz of one of the frequencies specified in § 25.211(a).</P>
                      <P>(c) In the 14.0 through 14.5 GHz band, an earth station with an antenna equivalent diameter of 1.2 meters or greater may be routinely licensed for transmission of narrowband analog services with bandwidths up to 200 kHz if the maximum input power spectral density into the antenna does not exceed −8 dBW/4 kHz and the maximum transmitted satellite carrier EIRP density does not exceed 17 dBW/4 kHz. Such earth stations may be routinely licensed for transmission of narrowband and/or wideband digital services, including digital video services, if the maximum input spectral power density into the antenna does not exceed −14 dBW/4 kHz, and the maximum transmitted satellite carrier EIRP density does not exceed +10.0 dBW/4 kHz. Antennas transmitting in the 14.0 through 14.5 GHz band with a major and/or minor axis smaller than 1.2 meters are subject to the provisions of § 25.220, which may include power reduction requirements.</P>
                      <P>(d)(1) For earth stations licensed before March 10, 2005 in the 5925-6425 MHz band, an earth station with an equivalent diameter of 4.5 meters or greater may be routinely licensed for transmission of SCPC services if the maximum power densities into the antenna do not exceed +0.5 dBW/4 kHz for analog SCPC carriers with bandwidths up to 200 kHz, and do not exceed −2.7 dBW/4 kHz for narrow and/or wideband digital SCPC carriers.</P>

                      <P>(2) For earth stations licensed after March 10, 2005 in the 5925-6425 MHz band, an earth station with an equivalent diameter of 4.5 meters or greater may be routinely licensed for transmission of SCPC services if the maximum power densities into the antenna do not exceed +0.5 dBW/4 kHz for analog SCPC carriers with bandwidths up to 200 kHz, and do not exceed −2.7 − 10log(N) dBW/4 kHz for narrow and/or wideband digital SCPC carriers. For digital SCPC using frequency division multiple access (FDMA) or time division multiple access (TDMA) technique, N is equal to one. For digital <PRTPAGE P="248"/>SCPC using code division multiple access (CDMA) technique, N is the maximum number of co-frequency simultaneously transmitting earth stations in the same satellite receiving beam.</P>
                      <P>(3) Antennas with an equivalent diameter smaller than 4.5 meters in the 5925-6425 MHz band are subject to the provisions of § 25.220 of this chapter, which may include power reduction requirements.</P>
                      <P>(e) Each applicant for authorization for transmissions in the fixed-satellite service proposing to use transmitted satellite carrier EIRP densities, and/or maximum antenna input power densities in excess of those specified in paragraph (c) of this section in the 14.0-14.5 GHz band, or in paragraph (d) of this section in the 5925-6425 MHz band, respectively, must comply with the procedures set forth in § 25.220.</P>
                      <P>(f) In the 24.75-25.25 GHz band, an earth station that meets the antenna gain pattern requirements set forth in §§ 25.209(a) and (b) of this part may be routinely licensed if the maximum power density into the antenna does not exceed 3.5 dBW/MHz.</P>

                      <P>(1) <E T="03">Allocated bandwidth.</E> The term “allocated bandwidth” refers to the entry in the Table of Frequency Allocations of a given frequency band for the purpose of its use by one or more terrestrial or space radiocommunication services under specified conditions. This term shall be applied to the 2310-2360 MHz band for satellite DARS.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Frequency Assignment.</E> The term “frequency assignment” refers to the authorization given by the Commission for a radio station to use a radio frequency or radio frequency channel under specified conditions.

                      <P>(b) Each system authorized under this section will be conditioned upon construction, launch and operation milestones as outlined in § 25.144(b). The failure to meet any of the milestones contained in an authorization will result in its cancellation, unless such failure is due to circumstances beyond the licensee's control or unless <PRTPAGE P="250"/>otherwise determined by the Commission upon proper showing by the licensee in any particular case.</P>
                      <P>(c) Frequency assignments will be made for each satellite DARS system as follows:</P>
                      <P>(1) Exclusive satellite DARS licenses are limited to the 2320-2345 MHz band segment of the allocated bandwidth for satellite DARS;</P>

                      <P>(4) Each licensee may employ cross polarization within its exclusive frequency assignment and/or may employ cross polarized transmissions in frequency assignments of other satellite DARS licensees under mutual agreement with those licensees. Licensees who come to mutual agreement to use cross-polarized transmissions shall apply to the Commission for approval of the agreement before coordination is initiated with other administrations by the licensee of the exclusive frequency assignment; and</P>

                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Power limit for SDARS terrestrial repeaters.</E> (1) SDARS terrestrial repeaters must be operated at a power level less than or equal to 12-kW average EIRP, with a maximum peak-to-average power ratio of 13 dB.</P>
                      <P>(2) SDARS repeaters are permitted to operate at power levels above 12-kW average EIRP, unless a potentially affected WCS licensee provides written notice that it intends to commence commercial service within the following 365 days. Starting 180 days after receipt of such written notice, SDARS repeaters within the area notified by the potentially affected WCS licensee must be operated at a power level less than or equal to 12-kW average EIRP, with a maximum peak-to-average power ratio of 13 dB.</P>

The EIRP, measured over any two-millisecond active transmission interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth from such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW in the 1559-1610 MHz band. The EIRP density of carrier-off-state emissions from such mobile terminals shall not exceed -80 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 MHz band, averaged over a two-millisecond interval. A root-mean-square detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or equivalent and no less video bandwidth shall be used to measure wideband EIRP density for purposes of this rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be measured with a root-mean-square detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one kilohertz or equivalent.</P>
                      <P>(c) For ATC operations in the 2000-2020 MHz band, the power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, in accordance with the following:</P>
                      <P>(1) On any frequency within the 2000 to 2020 MHz band outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operations, emissions shall be attenuated by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.</P>
                      <P>(2) Emissions on frequencies lower than 1995 MHz and higher than 2025 MHz shall be attenuated by at least 70 + 10 log P. Emissions in the bands 1995-2000 MHz and 2020-2025 MHz shall be attenuated by at least a value as determined by linear interpolation from 70 + 10 log P at 1995 MHz or 2025 MHz, to 43 + 10 log P dB at the nearest MSS band edge at 2000 MHz or 2020 MHz respectively.</P>

                      <P>(f) Prior to operation, ancillary terrestrial component licensees shall:</P>

                      <P>(1) Provide the Commission with sufficient information to complete coordination of ATC base stations with Search-and-Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) earth stations operating in the 1544-1545 MHz band for any ATC base station located either within 27 km of a SARSAT station, or <PRTPAGE P="281"/>within radio horizon of the SARSAT station, whichever is less.</P>
                      <P>(2) Take all practicable steps to avoid locating ATC base stations within radio line of sight of Mobile Aeronautical Telemetry (MAT) receive sites in order to protect U.S. MAT systems consistent with ITU-R Recommendation ITU-R M.1459. MSS ATC base stations located within radio line of sight of a MAT receiver must be coordinated with the Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC) for non-Government MAT receivers on a case-by-case basis prior to operation. For government MAT receivers, the MSS licensee shall supply sufficient information to the Commission to allow coordination to take place. A listing of current and planned MAT receiver sites can be obtained from AFTRCC for non-Government sites and through the FCC's IRAC Liaison for Government MAT receiver sites.</P>
                      <P>(g) ATC mobile terminals shall:</P>
                      <P>(1) Be limited to a peak EIRP level of 0 dBW and an out-of-channel emissions of −67 dBW/4 kHz at the edge of an MSS licensee's authorized and internationally coordinated MSS frequency assignment.</P>
                      <P>(2) Be operated in a fashion that takes all practicable steps to avoid causing interference to U.S. radio astronomy service (RAS) observations in the 1660-1660.5 MHz band.</P>
                      <P>(3) Not generate EIRP density, averaged over any two-millisecond active transmission interval, greater than −70 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1605 MHz band or greater than a level determined by linear interpolation in the 1605-1610 MHz band, from −70 dBW/MHz at 1605 MHz to −46 dBW/MHz at 1610 MHz. The EIRP, averaged over any two-millisecond active transmission interval, of discrete out-of-band emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth from such mobile terminals shall not exceed −80 dBW in the 1559-1605 MHz band or exceed a level determined by linear interpolation in the 1605-1610 MHz band, from −80 dBW at 1605 MHz to −56 dBW at 1610 MHz. The EIRP density of carrier-off-state emissions from such mobile terminals shall not exceed −80 dBW/MHz in the 1559-1610 MHz band, averaged over a two-millisecond interval. A root-mean-square detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or equivalent and no less video bandwidth shall be used to measure wideband EIRP density for purposes of this rule, and narrowband EIRP shall be measured with a root-mean-square detector function with a resolution bandwidth of one kilohertz or equivalent.</P>
                      <P>(h) When implementing multiple base stations and/or base stations using multiple carriers, where any third-order intermodulation product of these base stations falls on an L-band MSS band coordinated for use by another MSS operator with rights to the coordinated band, the MSS ATC licensee must notify the MSS operator. The MSS operator may request coordination to modify the base station carrier frequencies, or to reduce the maximum base station EIRP on the frequencies contributing to the third-order intermodulation products. The threshold for this notification and coordination is when the sum of the calculated signal levels received by an MSS receiver exceeds −70 dBm. The MSS receiver used in these calculations can be assumed to have an antenna with 0 dBi gain. Free-space propagation between the base station antennas and the MSS terminals can be assumed and actual signal polarizations for the ATC signals and the MSS system may be used.</P>

                      <P>(d) To avoid interference to an adjacent channel licensee in the Broadband Radio Service (BRS), the power of any ATC base station emission above 2495 MHz shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) measured in watts in accordance with the standards below. If these measures do not resolve a documented interference complaint received from the adjacent channel <PRTPAGE P="283"/>BRS licensee, the provisions of § 25.255 shall apply.</P>
                      <P>(1) For base stations, the attenuation shall be not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at the upper edge of the authorized ATC band, unless a documented interference complaint is received from an adjacent channel licensee in the BRS. Provided that a documented interference complaint cannot be mutually resolved between the parties, the following additional attenuation requirements set forth in subsections (2)-(5) shall apply:</P>
                      <P>(2) If a pre-existing BRS base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a new or modified ATC base station located 1.5 km or more away, within 24 hours of the receipt of a documented interference complaint the ATC licensee must attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band, and shall immediately notify the complaining licensee upon implementation of the additional attenuation.</P>

                      <P>(3) If a pre-existing BRS base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a new or modified ATC base station located less than 1.5 km away, within 24 hours of the receipt of a documented interference complaint the ATC licensee must attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) −20 log(D<E T="52">km</E>/1.5) dB measured at 3 megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band, or if both base stations are co-located, limit its undesired signal level at the pre-existing BRS base station receiver(s) to no more than −107 dBm measured in a 5.5 megahertz bandwidth and shall immediately notify the complaining licensee upon such reduction in the undesired signal level.</P>
                      <P>(4) If a new or modified BRS base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a pre-existing ATC base station located 1.5 km or more away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented interference complaint the licensee of the ATC base station must attenuate its base station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band.</P>
                      <P>(5) If a new or modified BRS base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a pre-existing ATC base station located less than 1.5 km away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented interference complaint:</P>

                      <P>(i) the ATC licensee must attenuate its base station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) −20 log(D<E T="52">km</E>/1.5) dB measured 3 megahertz above the edge of the authorized ATC band, or</P>
                      <P>(ii) if both base stations are co-located, the ATC licensee must limit its undesired signal level at the new or modified BRS base station receiver(s) to no more than −107 dBm measured in a 5.5 megahertz bandwidth.</P>

                      <P>(6) Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately above and adjacent to the 2495 MHz a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy, provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (i.e., 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power. When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.

When calculating the protection areas for a NOAA satellite in the 137.333-137.367 MHz, 137.485-137.515 MHz, 137.605-137.635 MHz and 137.753-137.787 MHz bands, a NVNG licensee shall use an earth station elevation angle of five degrees towards the NOAA satellite and will cease its transmissions prior to the NVNG licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle of zero degrees towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the NOAA protection area. When calculating the protection areas for a NOAA satellite in the 137.025-137.175 MHz and 137.825-138 MHz bands, a NVNG licensee shall use an earth station elevation angle of zero degrees, or less if reasonably necessary, towards the NOAA satellite and will cease its transmissions prior to the NVNG licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle of zero degrees towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the NOAA protection area. A NVNG licensee is responsible for obtaining the necessary ephemeris data. This information shall be updated system-wide on at least a weekly basis. A NVNG licensee shall use an orbital propagator algorithm with an accuracy equal to or greater than the NORAD propagator used by NOAA.</P>
                      <P>(b) A NVNG licensee time sharing spectrum in the 137-138 MHz band shall establish a 24-hour per day contact person and telephone number so that claims of harmful interference into NOAA earth station users and other operational issues can be reported and resolved expeditiously. This contact information shall be made available to NOAA or its designee. If the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) notifies the Commission that NOAA is receiving unacceptable interference from a NVNG licensee, the Commission will require such NVNG licensee to terminate its interfering operations immediately unless it demonstrates to the Commission's reasonable satisfaction, and that of NTIA, that it is not responsible for causing harmful interference into the worldwide NOAA system. A NVNG licensee assumes the risk of any liability or damage that it and its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and subcontractors may incur or suffer in connection with an interruption of its non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service, in whole or in part, arising from or relating to its compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of this paragraph (b).

When calculating the protection areas for a DoD satellite in the 400.15-401 MHz band, a NVNG licensee shall use an earth station elevation angle of five degrees towards the DoD satellite and will shut off its transmissions prior to the NVNG licensee's service area, based on an elevation angle of zero degrees towards the NVNG licensee's satellite, overlapping the DoD protection area. A NVNG licensee is responsible for obtaining the necessary ephemeris data. This information shall be updated system-wide at least once per week. A NVNG licensee shall use an orbital propagator algorithm with an accuracy equal to or greater than the NORAD propagator used by DoD.</P>
                      <P>(b) A NVNG licensee time sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401 MHz band shall establish a 24-hour per day contact person and telephone number so that claims of harmful interference into DoD earth station users and other operational issues can be reported and resolved expeditiously. This contact information shall be made available to DoD or its designee. If the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) notifies the Commission that DoD is receiving unacceptable interference from a NVNG licensee, the Commission will require such NVNG licensee to terminate its interfering operations immediately unless it demonstrates to the Commission's reasonable satisfaction, and that of NTIA, that it is not responsible for causing harmful interference into the worldwide DoD system. A NVNG licensee assumes the risk of any liability or damage that it and its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents and subcontractors may incur or suffer in connection with an interruption of its non-voice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service, in whole or in part, arising from or relating to its compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of this paragraph (b). The Commission will not hesitate to impose sanctions on a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum in the 400.15-401 MHz band with DoD, including monetary forfeitures and license revocations, when appropriate.</P>
                      <P>(c) Each satellite in a NVNG licensee's system time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 400.15-401 MHz band shall automatically turn off and cease satellite transmissions if, after 72 consecutive hours, no reset signal is received from the NVNG licensee's gateway earth station and verified by the satellite. All satellites in such NVNG licensee's system shall be capable of instantaneous shutdown on any sub-band upon command from such NVNG licensee's gateway earth station.</P>
                      <P>(d) Initially, a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 400.15-401 MHz band shall be able to change the frequency on which its system satellites are operating within 125 minutes of receiving notification from a DoD required frequency change in the 400.15-401 MHz band. Thereafter, when a NVNG licensee constructs additional gateway earth stations located outside of North and South America, it shall use its best efforts to decrease to 90 minutes the time required to implement a DoD required frequency change. A NVNG licensee promptly shall notify the Commission and NTIA of any decrease in the time it requires to implement a DoD required frequency change.</P>

                      <P>(e) Once a NVNG licensee time-sharing spectrum with DoD in the 400.15-401 MHz band demonstrates to DoD that it is capable of implementing a DoD required frequency change within the time required under paragraph (d) of this section, thereafter, such NVNG licensee shall demonstrate its capability to implement a DoD required frequency change only once per year at the instruction of DoD. Such demonstrations shall occur during off-peak hours, as determined by the NVNG licensee, unless otherwise agreed by the NVNG licensee and DoD. Such NVNG licensee will coordinate with DoD in establishing a plan for such a demonstration. In the event that a NVNG licensee fails to demonstrate to DoD <PRTPAGE P="287"/>that it is capable of implementing a DoD required frequency change in accordance with a demonstration plan established by DoD and the NVNG licensee, upon the Commission's receipt of a written notification from NTIA describing such failure, the Commission shall impose additional conditions or requirements on the NVNG licensee's authorization as may be necessary to protect DoD operations in the 400.15-401 MHz downlink band until the Commission is notified by NTIA that the NVNG licensee has successfully demonstrated its ability to implement a DoD required frequency change. Such additional conditions or requirements may include, but are not limited to, requiring such NVNG licensee immediately to terminate its operations interfering with the DoD system.</P>

                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Coordination procedure.</E> Any coordination procedure agreed among the affected operating satellite networks, which allows operations of the satellite networks when each network's respective space stations are within the 10 degree avoidance angle associated with an in-line interference event, shall supersede the default procedure of paragraph (c) of this section. Coordination may be effected using information relating to the space stations and the parameters of one or more typical earth stations. All parties are required to coordinate in good faith.</P>

                      <P>(c)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, licensees and permittees will be allowed to apply for a license or authorization for a replacement satellite that will be operated at the same power level and interference protection as the satellite to be replaced.</P>
                      <P>(2) In addition, applicants for licenses or authority for a satellite to be operated at an orbit location that was made available after a previous 17/24 GHz BSS license was cancelled or surrendered will be permitted to apply for authority to operate a satellite at the same power level and interference protection as the previous licensee at that orbit location, to the extent that their proposed operations are consistent with the provisions of this part. Such applications will be considered pursuant to the first-come, first-served procedures set forth in § 25.158 of this part.</P>
                      <P>(d) Any U.S. licensee or permittee using a 17/24 GHz BSS space station that is located less than four degrees away from a prior-authorized 17/24 GHz BSS space station that is authorized to operate in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
                      <P>(1) may not cause any more interference to the adjacent satellite network than would be caused if the adjacent 17/24 GHz BSS space station were located four degrees away from the proposed space station; and</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Information sharing requirements for SDARS terrestrial repeater operators.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>This section requires SDARS licensees in the 2320-2345 MHz band to share information regarding the location and operation of terrestrial repeaters with WCS licensees in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands. Section 27.72 of this chapter requires WCS licensees to share information regarding the location and operation of base stations in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands with SDARS licensees in the 2320-2345 MHz band.</P>

                      <P>(a) SDARS licensees must select terrestrial repeater sites and frequencies, <PRTPAGE P="289"/>to the extent practicable, to minimize the possibility of harmful interference to WCS base station operations in the 2305-2320 MHz and 2345-2360 MHz bands.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice requirements.</E> SDARS licensees that intend to operate a new terrestrial repeater must, before commencing such operation, provide 10 business days prior notice to all potentially affected WCS licensees. SDARS licensees that intend to modify an existing repeater must, before commencing such modified operation, provide 5 business days prior notice to all potentially affected WCS licensees.</P>
                      <P>(1) For purposes of this section, a “potentially affected WCS licensee” is a WCS licensee that:</P>
                      <P>(i) Is authorized to operate a base station in the 2305-2315 MHz or 2350-2360 MHz bands in the same Major Economic Area (MEA) as that in which the terrestrial repeater is to be located;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Is authorized to operate a base station in the 2315-2320 MHz or 2345-2350 MHz bands in the same Regional Economic Area Grouping (REAG) as that in which the terrestrial repeater is to be located.</P>
                      <P>(iii) In addition to the WCS licensees identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, in cases in which the SDARS licensee plans to deploy or modify a terrestrial repeater within 5 kilometers of the boundary of an MEA or REAG in which the terrestrial repeater is to be located, a potentially affected WCS licensee is one that is authorized to operate a WCS base station in that neighboring MEA or REAG within 5 kilometers of the location of the terrestrial repeater.</P>
                      <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a business day is defined by § 1.4(e)(2) of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> (1) Notification must be written (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> certified letter, fax, or e-mail) and include the licensee's name, and the name, address, and telephone number of its coordination representative, unless the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected WCS licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some other means. WCS licensees and SDARS licensees may establish such a mutually agreeable alternative notification mechanism without prior Commission approval, provided that they comply with all other requirements of this section.</P>
                      <P>(2) Regardless of the notification method, notification must specify relevant technical details, including, at a minimum:</P>
                      <P>(i) The coordinates of the proposed repeater to an accuracy of no less than ± 1 second latitude and longitude;</P>
                      <P>(ii) The proposed operating power(s), frequency band(s), and emission(s);</P>
                      <P>(iii) The antenna center height above ground and ground elevation above mean sea level, both to an accuracy of no less than ±1 meter;</P>
                      <P>(iv) The antenna gain pattern(s) in the azimuth and elevation planes that include the peak of the main beam; and</P>
                      <P>(v) The antenna downtilt angle(s).</P>
                      <P>(3) An SDARS licensee operating terrestrial repeaters must maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of its terrestrial repeaters operating above 2 watts average EIRP, including the information set forth in § 25.263(c)(2), which shall be available upon request by the Commission.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculation of Notice Period.</E> Notice periods are calculated from the date of receipt by the licensee being notified. If notification is by mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by the return receipt on certified mail. If notification is by fax, the date of receipt is evidenced by the notifying party's fax transmission confirmation log. If notification is by e-mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by a return e-mail receipt. If the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected WCS licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some other means, that agreement must specify the method for determining the beginning of the notice period.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Duty to cooperate.</E> SDARS licensees must cooperate in good faith in the selection and use of new repeater sites to reduce interference and make the most effective use of the authorized facilities. Licensees of stations suffering or causing harmful interference must cooperate in good faith and resolve such problems by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the International Bureau, in consultation with the Office of Engineering and Technology and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, <PRTPAGE P="290"/>may impose restrictions on SDARS licensees, including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or area or hours of operation of the stations.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Requirements to facilitate reverse-band operation in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band of 17/24 GHz Broadcasting-satellite Service and Direct Broadcast Satellite Service space stations.</SUBJECT>

                      <P>(a) Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite service (BSS) must provide a series of tables or graphs with its application, that contain the predicted transmitting antenna off-axis gain information for each transmitting antenna in the 17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band. Using a Cartesian coordinate system wherein the X axis is tangent to the geostationary orbital arc with the positive direction pointing east, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, in the direction of travel of the satellite; the Y axis is parallel to a line passing through the geographic north and south poles of the Earth, with the positive direction pointing south; and the Z axis passes through the satellite and the center of the Earth, with the positive direction pointing toward the Earth, the applicant must provide the predicted transmitting antenna off-axis antenna gain information:</P>
                      <P>(1) In the X-Z plane, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the plane of the geostationary orbit, over a range of ± 30 degrees from the positive and negative X axes in increments of 5 degrees or less.</P>
                      <P>(2) In planes rotated from the X-Z plane about the Z axis, over a range of ±60 degrees relative to the equatorial plane, in increments of 10 degrees or less.</P>
                      <P>(3) In both polarizations.</P>
                      <P>(4) At a minimum of three measurement frequencies determined with respect to the entire portion of the 17.3-17.8 GHz frequency band over which the space station is designed to transmit: 5 MHz above the lower edge of the band; at the band center frequency; and 5 MHz below the upper edge of the band.</P>
                      <P>(5) Over a greater angular measurement range, if necessary, to account for any planned spacecraft orientation bias or change in operating orientation relative to the reference coordinate system. The applicant must also explain its reasons for doing so.</P>
                      <P>(b) Each applicant for a space station license in the 17/24 GHz BSS must provide power flux density (pfd) calculations with its application that are based upon the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain information submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:</P>
                      <P>(1) The pfd calculations must be provided at the location of all prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations where the applicant's pfd level exceeds the coordination trigger of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band. In this rule, the term prior-filed U.S. DBS space station refers to any Direct Broadcast Satellite service space station application that was filed with the Commission (or authorization granted by the Commission) prior to the filing of the 17/24 GHz BSS application containing the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain information. The term prior-filed U.S. DBS space station does not include any applications (or authorizations) that have been denied, dismissed, or are otherwise no longer valid. Prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations may include foreign-licensed DBS space stations seeking authority to serve the United States market, but do not include foreign-licensed DBS space stations that have not filed applications with the Commission for market access in the United States.</P>
                      <P>(2) The pfd calculations must take into account the maximum permitted longitudinal station-keeping tolerance, orbital inclination and orbital eccentricity of both the 17/24 GHz BSS and DBS space stations, and must:</P>
                      <P>(i) Identify each prior-filed U.S. DBS space station at whose location the coordination threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz is exceeded; and</P>
                      <P>(ii) Demonstrate the extent to which the applicant's transmissions in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceed the threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz at those prior-filed U.S. DBS space station locations.</P>

                      <P>(3) If the calculated pfd level is in excess of the threshold level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz at the location of any prior-filed U.S. DBS space station, the applicant must also provide with its application certification that all affected <PRTPAGE P="291"/>DBS operators acknowledge and do not object to the applicants higher off-axis pfd levels. No such certification is required in cases where the DBS and 17/24 GHz BSS assigned operating frequencies do not overlap.</P>
                      <P>(c) No later than 9 months prior to launch, each 17/24 GHz BSS space station applicant or authorization holder must confirm the predicted transmitting antenna off-axis gain information provided in accordance with § 25.114(d)(15)(iv) by submitting measured transmitting antenna off-axis gain information over the angular ranges, measurement frequencies and polarizations described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. The transmitting antenna off-axis gain information should be measured under conditions as close to flight configuration as possible.</P>
                      <P>(d) No later than 9 months prior to launch, each 17/24 GHz BSS space station applicant or authorization holder must provide pfd calculations based upon the measured transmitting antenna off-axis gain information that is submitted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section as follows:</P>
                      <P>(1) The pfd calculations must be provided:</P>
                      <P>(i) At the location of all prior-filed U.S. DBS space stations as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, where the applicant's pfd level in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceeds the coordination trigger of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz; and</P>
                      <P>(ii) At the location of any subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station where the applicant's pfd level in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceeds the coordination trigger of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz. In this rule, the term subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station refers to any Direct Broadcast Satellite service space station application that was filed with the Commission (or authorization granted by the Commission) after the 17/24 GHz BSS operator submitted the predicted data required by paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section, but prior to the time the 17/24 GHz BSS operator submitted the measured data required in this paragraph. Subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space stations may include foreign-licensed DBS space stations seeking authority to serve the United States market. The term does not include any applications (or authorizations) that have been denied, dismissed, or are otherwise no longer valid, nor does it include foreign-licensed DBS space stations that have not filed applications with the Commission for market access in the United States.</P>
                      <P>(2) The pfd calculations must take into account the maximum permitted longitudinal station-keeping tolerance, orbital inclination and orbital eccentricity of both the 17/24 GHz BSS and DBS space stations, and must:</P>
                      <P>(i) Identify each prior-filed U.S. DBS space station at whose location the coordination threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz is exceeded; and</P>
                      <P>(ii) Demonstrate the extent to which the applicant's or licensee's transmissions in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band exceed the threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz at those prior-filed U.S. DBS space station locations.</P>
                      <P>(e) If the pfd level calculated from the measured data submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section is in excess of the threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz:</P>
                      <P>(1) At the location of any prior-filed U.S. DBS space station as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite operator must either:</P>
                      <P>(i) Coordinate its operations that are in excess of the threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz with the affected prior-filed U.S. DBS space station operator, or</P>
                      <P>(ii) Adjust its operating parameters so that at the location of the prior-filed U.S. DBS space station, the pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz is not exceeded.</P>

                      <P>(2) At the location of any subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, where the pfd level submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, is also in excess of the pfd level calculated on the basis of the predicted data submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section that were on file with the Commission at the time the DBS space station application was filed, then the 17/24 GHz broadcasting-satellite operator must either:<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(i) Coordinate with the affected subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station operator all of its operations that are either in excess of the pfd level calculated on the basis of the predicted antenna off-axis gain data, or are in excess of the threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz, whichever is greater, or</P>
                      <P>(ii) Adjust its operating parameters so that at the location of the subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station, either the pfd level calculated on the basis of the predicted off-axis transmitting antenna gain data, or the threshold pfd level of −117 dBW/m<SU>2</SU>/100 kHz, whichever is greater, is not exceeded.</P>
                      <P>(3) No coordination or adjustment of operating parameters is required in cases where the DBS and 17/24 GHz BSS operating frequencies do not overlap.</P>
                      <P>(f) The 17/24 GHz BSS applicant or licensee must modify its license, or amend its application, as appropriate, based upon new information:</P>
                      <P>(1) If the pfd levels submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, are in excess of those submitted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section at the location of any prior-filed or subsequently-filed U.S. DBS space station as defined in paragraphs (b)(1) and (d)(1)of this section, or</P>
                      <P>(2) If the 17/24 GHz BSS operator adjusts its operating parameters in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2)(ii) or this section.</P>
                      <P>(g) Absent an explicit agreement between operators to permit more closely spaced operations, U.S. authorized 17/24 GHz BSS space stations and U.S. authorized DBS space stations with co-frequency assignments may not be licensed to operate at locations separated by less than 0.2 degrees in orbital longitude.</P>
                      <P>(h) All operational 17/24 GHz BSS space stations must be maintained in geostationary orbits that:</P>
                      <P>(1) Do not exceed 0.075° of inclination.</P>

                      <P>(2) Operate with an apogee less than or equal to 35,806 km above the surface of the Earth, and with a perigee greater than or equal to 35,766 km above the surface of the Earth (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, an eccentricity of less than 4.7 × 10<E T="51">−4</E>).</P>

When the geostationary orbit of the DBS space station exceeds these bounds on inclination and eccentricity, it may not claim protection from any additional space path interference arising as a result of its inclined or eccentric operations and may only claim protection as if it were operating within the bounds listed below:</P>
                      <P>(1) The DBS space station's orbit does not exceed 0.075° of inclination, and</P>

                      <P>(2) The DBS space station's orbit maintains an apogee less than or equal to 35,806 km above the surface of the Earth, and a perigee greater than or equal to 35,766 km above the surface of the Earth (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> an eccentricity of less than 4.7 × 10<E T="51">−4</E>).</P>

                      <P>(b) The earth station operator shall then check all other earth stations in the licensee's network that could be causing the harmful interference to ensure that none of the licensee's earth stations are the source of the interference and to verify that the source of interference is not from a local terrestrial source.</P>
                      <P>(c) After the earth station operator has determined that the source of the interference is not another earth station operating in the same network or from a terrestrial source, the earth station operator shall contact the satellite system control center and advise the satellite operator of the problem. The control center operator shall observe the interference incident and make reasonable efforts to determine the source of the problem. A record shall be maintained by the control center operator and the earth station operator of all harmful interference incidents and their resolution. These records shall be made available to an FCC representative on request.</P>
                      <P>(d) Where the suspected source of the interference incident is the operation of an earth station licensed to operate on one or more of the satellites in the satellite operator's system, the control center operator shall advise the offending earth station of the harmful interference incident and assist in the resolution of the problem where reasonably possible.</P>

                      <P>(e) The earth station licensee whose operations are suspected of causing <PRTPAGE P="295"/>harmful interference to the operations of another earth station shall take reasonable measures to determine whether its operations are the source of the harmful interference problem. Where the operations of the suspect earth station are the source of the interference, the licensee of that earth station shall take all measures necessary to resolve the interference.</P>
                      <P>(f) Where the earth station suspected of causing harmful interference to the operations of another earth station cannot be identified or is identified as an earth station operating on a satellite system other than the one on which the earth station suffering harmful interference is operating, it is the responsibility of a representative of the earth station suffering harmful interference to contact the control center of other satellite systems. The operator of the earth station suffering harmful interference is free to choose any representative to make this contact, including but not limited to the operator of the satellite system on which the earth station is operating. The operator of the earth station suffering harmful interference is also free to contact the control center of the other satellite systems directly.</P>
                      <P>(g) At any point, the system control center operator may contact the Commission's Columbia Operations Center in Columbia, Maryland, to assist in resolving the matter. This office specializes in the resolution of satellite interference problems. All licensees are required to cooperate fully with the Commission in any investigation of interference problems.</P>

                      <P>(1) Entities licensed to operate satellites in the 12.2 to 12.7 GHz DBS frequency bands; or</P>
                      <P>(2) Entities licensed to operate satellites in the Ku band fixed satellite service and that sell or lease capacity to a video programming distributor that offers service directly to consumers providing a sufficient number of channels so that four percent of the total applicable programming channels yields a set aside of at least one channel of non commercial programming pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or</P>
                      <P>(3) Non U.S. licensed satellite operators in the Ku band that offer video programming directly to consumers in the United States pursuant to an earth station license issued under part 25 of this title and that offer a sufficient number of channels to consumers so that four percent of the total applicable programming channels yields a set aside of one channel of noncommercial programming pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or</P>

                      <P>(4) Entities licensed to operate satellites in the 17/24 GHz BSS that offer video programming directly to consumers or that sell or lease capacity to a video programming distributor that offers service directly to consumers providing a sufficient number of channels so that four percent of the total applicable programming channels yields a set aside of at least one channel of noncommercial programming <PRTPAGE P="301"/>pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or</P>
                      <P>(5) Non U.S. licensed satellite operators in the 17/24 GHz BSS that offer video programming directly to consumers in the United States or that sell or lease capacity to a video programming distributor that offers service directly to consumers in the United States pursuant to an earth station license issued under part 25 of this title and that offer a sufficient number of channels to consumers so that four percent of the total applicable programming channels yields a set aside of one channel of noncommercial programming pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(b) Political broadcasting requirements—</P>
                      <P>(1) Legally qualified candidates for public office for purposes of this section are as defined in § 73.1940 of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(2) DBS origination programming is defined as programming (exclusive of broadcast signals) carried on a DBS facility over one or more channels and subject to the exclusive control of the DBS provider.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Reasonable access.</E> (i) DBS providers must comply with section 312(a)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, by allowing reasonable access to, or permitting purchase of reasonable amounts of time for, the use of their facilities by a legally qualified candidate for federal elective office on behalf of his or her candidacy.</P>
                      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Weekend access.</E> For purposes of providing reasonable access, DBS providers shall make facilities available for use by federal candidates on the weekend before the election if the DBS provider has provided similar access to commercial advertisers during the year preceding the relevant election period. DBS providers shall not discriminate between candidates with regard to weekend access.</P>
                      <P>(4) <E T="03">Use of facilities; equal opportunities.</E> DBS providers must comply with section 315 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, by providing equal opportunities to legally qualified candidates for DBS origination programming.</P>
                      <P>(i) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> Except as otherwise indicated in § 25.701(b)(3), no DBS provider is required to permit the use of its facilities by any legally qualified candidate for public office, but if a DBS provider shall permit any such candidate to use its facilities, it shall afford equal opportunities to all other candidates for that office to use such facilities. Such DBS provider shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast by any such candidate. Appearance by a legally qualified candidate on any:</P>
                      <P>(A) Bona fide newscast;</P>
                      <P>(B) Bona fide news interview;</P>
                      <P>(C) Bona fide news documentary (if the appearance of the candidate is incidental to the presentation of the subject or subjects covered by the news documentary); or</P>
                      <P>(D) On the spot coverage of bona fide news events (including, but not limited to political conventions and activities incidental thereto) shall not be deemed to be use of a DBS provider's facility. (Section 315(a) of the Communications Act.)</P>
                      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Uses.</E> As used in this section and § 25.701(c), the term “use” means a candidate appearance (including by voice or picture) that is not exempt under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (b)(3)(i)(D) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(iii) <E T="03">Timing of request.</E> A request for equal opportunities must be submitted to the DBS provider within 1 week of the day on which the first prior use giving rise to the right of equal opportunities occurred: Provided, however, That where the person was not a candidate at the time of such first prior use, he or she shall submit his or her request within 1 week of the first subsequent use after he or she has become a legally qualified candidate for the office in question.</P>
                      <P>(iv) <E T="03">Burden of proof.</E> A candidate requesting equal opportunities of the DBS provider or complaining of noncompliance to the Commission shall have the burden of proving that he or she and his or her opponent are legally qualified candidates for the same public office.</P>
                      <P>(v) <E T="03">Discrimination between candidates.</E> In making time available to candidates for public office, no DBS provider shall make any discrimination between candidates in practices, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection <PRTPAGE P="302"/>with the service rendered pursuant to this part, or make or give any preference to any candidate for public office or subject any such candidate to any prejudice or disadvantage; nor shall any DBS provider make any contract or other agreement that shall have the effect of permitting any legally qualified candidate for any public office to use DBS origination programming to the exclusion of other legally qualified candidates for the same public office.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Candidate rates</E>—(1) <E T="03">Charges for use of DBS facilities.</E> The charges, if any, made for the use of any DBS facility by any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office in connection with his or her campaign for nomination for election, or election, to such office shall not exceed:</P>
                      <P>(i) During the 45 days preceding the date of a primary or primary runoff election and during the 60 days preceding the date of a general or special election in which such person is a candidate, the lowest unit charge of the DBS provider for the same class and amount of time for the same period.</P>
                      <P>(A) A candidate shall be charged no more per unit than the DBS provider charges its most favored commercial advertisers for the same classes and amounts of time for the same periods. Any facility practices offered to commercial advertisers that enhance the value of advertising spots must be disclosed and made available to candidates upon equal terms. Such practices include but are not limited to any discount privileges that affect the value of advertising, such as bonus spots, time sensitive make goods, preemption priorities, or any other factors that enhance the value of the announcement.</P>
                      <P>(B) The Commission recognizes non preemptible, preemptible with notice, immediately preemptible and run of schedule as distinct classes of time.</P>
                      <P>(C) DBS providers may establish and define their own reasonable classes of immediately preemptible time so long as the differences between such classes are based on one or more demonstrable benefits associated with each class and are not based solely upon price or identity of the advertiser. Such demonstrable benefits include, but are not limited to, varying levels of preemption protection, scheduling flexibility, or associated privileges, such as guaranteed time sensitive make goods. DBS providers may not use class distinctions to defeat the purpose of the lowest unit charge requirement. All classes must be fully disclosed and made available to candidates.</P>
                      <P>(D) DBS providers may establish reasonable classes of preemptible with notice time so long as they clearly define all such classes, fully disclose them and make them available to candidates.</P>
                      <P>(E) DBS providers may treat non preemptible and fixed position as distinct classes of time provided that they articulate clearly the differences between such classes, fully disclose them, and make them available to candidates.</P>
                      <P>(F) DBS providers shall not establish a separate, premium priced class of time sold only to candidates. DBS providers may sell higher priced non preemptible or fixed time to candidates if such a class of time is made available on a bona fide basis to both candidates and commercial advertisers, and provided such class is not functionally equivalent to any lower priced class of time sold to commercial advertisers.</P>
                      <P>(G) [Reserved]</P>
                      <P>(H) Lowest unit charge may be calculated on a weekly basis with respect to time that is sold on a weekly basis, such as rotations through particular programs or dayparts. DBS providers electing to calculate the lowest unit charge by such a method must include in that calculation all rates for all announcements scheduled in the rotation, including announcements aired under long term advertising contracts. DBS providers may implement rate increases during election periods only to the extent that such increases constitute “ordinary business practices,” such as seasonal program changes or changes in audience ratings.</P>

                      <P>(I) DBS providers shall review their advertising records periodically throughout the election period to determine whether compliance with this <PRTPAGE P="303"/>section requires that candidates receive rebates or credits. Where necessary, DBS providers shall issue such rebates or credits promptly.</P>
                      <P>(J) Unit rates charged as part of any package, whether individually negotiated or generally available to all advertisers, must be included in the lowest unit charge calculation for the same class and length of time in the same time period. A candidate cannot be required to purchase advertising in every program or daypart in a package as a condition for obtaining package unit rates.</P>
                      <P>(K) DBS providers are not required to include non cash promotional merchandising incentives in lowest unit charge calculations; provided, however, that all such incentives must be offered to candidates as part of any purchases permitted by the system. Bonus spots, however, must be included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge calculation.</P>
                      <P>(L) Make goods, defined as the rescheduling of preempted advertising, shall be provided to candidates prior to election day if a DBS provider has provided a time sensitive make good during the year preceding the pre election periods, respectively set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, to any commercial advertiser who purchased time in the same class.</P>
                      <P>(M) DBS providers must disclose and make available to candidates any make good policies provided to commercial advertisers. If a DBS provider places a make good for any commercial advertiser or other candidate in a more valuable program or daypart, the value of such make good must be included in the calculation of the lowest unit charge for that program or daypart.</P>
                      <P>(ii) At any time other than the respective periods set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, DBS providers may charge legally qualified candidates for public office no more than the charges made for comparable use of the facility by commercial advertisers. The rates, if any, charged all such candidates for the same office shall be uniform and shall not be rebated by any means, direct or indirect. A candidate shall be charged no more than the rate the DBS provider would charge for comparable commercial advertising. All discount privileges otherwise offered by a DBS provider to commercial advertisers must be disclosed and made available upon equal terms to all candidates for public office.</P>
                      <P>(2) If a DBS provider permits a candidate to use its facilities, it shall make all discount privileges offered to commercial advertisers, including the lowest unit charges for each class and length of time in the same time period and all corresponding discount privileges, available on equal terms to all candidates. This duty includes an affirmative duty to disclose to candidates information about rates, terms, conditions and all value enhancing discount privileges offered to commercial advertisers, as provided herein. DBS providers may use reasonable discretion in making the disclosure; provided, however, that the disclosure includes, at a minimum, the following information:</P>
                      <P>(i) A description and definition of each class of time available to commercial advertisers sufficiently complete enough to allow candidates to identify and understand what specific attributes differentiate each class;</P>
                      <P>(ii) A description of the lowest unit charge and related privileges (such as priorities against preemption and make goods prior to specific deadlines) for each class of time offered to commercial advertisers;</P>
                      <P>(iii) A description of the DBS provider's method of selling preemptible time based upon advertiser demand, commonly known as the “current selling level,” with the stipulation that candidates will be able to purchase at these demand generated rates in the same manner as commercial advertisers;</P>
                      <P>(iv) An approximation of the likelihood of preemption for each kind of preemptible time; and</P>
                      <P>(v) An explanation of the DBS provider's sales practices, if any, that are based on audience delivery, with the stipulation that candidates will be able to purchase this kind of time, if available to commercial advertisers.</P>

                      <P>(3) Once disclosure is made, DBS providers shall negotiate in good faith to actually sell time to candidates in accordance with the disclosure.<PRTPAGE P="304"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(d) Political file. Each DBS provider shall keep and permit public inspection of a complete and orderly political file and shall prominently disclose the physical location of the file, and the telephonic and electronic means to access the file.</P>
                      <P>(1) The political file shall contain, at a minimum:</P>
                      <P>(i) A record of all requests for DBS origination time, the disposition of those requests, and the charges made, if any, if the request is granted. The “disposition” includes the schedule of time purchased, when spots actually aired, the rates charged, and the classes of time purchased; and</P>
                      <P>(ii) A record of the free time provided if free time is provided for use by or on behalf of candidates.</P>
                      <P>(2) DBS providers shall place all records required by this section in a file available to the public as soon as possible and shall be retained for a period of four years until December 31, 2006, and thereafter for a period of two years.</P>
                      <P>(3) DBS providers shall make available, by fax, e-mail, or by mail upon telephone request, photocopies of documents in their political files and shall assist callers by answering questions about the contents of their political files. Provided, however, that if a requester prefers access by mail, the DBS provider shall pay for postage but may require individuals requesting documents to pay for photocopying. To the extent that a DBS provider places its political file on its Web site, it may refer the public to the Web site in lieu of mailing photocopies. Any material required by this section to be maintained in the political file must be made available to the public by either mailing or Web site access or both.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Commercial limits in children's programs.</E> (1) No DBS provider shall air more than 10.5 minutes of commercial matter per hour during children's programming on weekends, or more that 12 minutes of commercial matter per hour on week days.</P>
                      <P>(2) This rule shall not apply to programs aired on a broadcast television channel which the DBS provider passively carries, or to channels over which the DBS provider may not exercise editorial control, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 335(b)(3).</P>

                      <P>(3) DBS providers airing children's programming must maintain records sufficient to verify compliance with this rule and make such records available to the public. Such records must be maintained for a period sufficient to cover the limitations period specified in 47 U.S.C. 503(b)(6)(B).

                      <P>(1) <E T="03">Reservation requirement.</E> DBS providers shall reserve four percent of their channel capacity exclusively for use by qualified programmers for noncommercial programming of an educational or informational nature. Channel capacity shall be determined annually by calculating, based on measurements taken on a quarterly basis, the average number of channels available for video programming on all satellites licensed to the provider during the previous year. DBS providers may use this reserved capacity for any purpose until such time as it is used for noncommercial educational or informational programming.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Qualified programmer.</E> For purposes of these rules, a qualified programmer is:</P>
                      <P>(i) A noncommercial educational broadcast station as defined in section 397(6) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,</P>
                      <P>(ii) A public telecommunications entity as defined in section 397(12) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,</P>

                      <P>(iii) An accredited nonprofit educational institution or a governmental organization engaged in the formal education of enrolled students (A publicly supported educational institution must be accredited by the appropriate state department of education; a privately controlled educational institution must be accredited by the appropriate state department of education or <PRTPAGE P="305"/>the recognized regional and national accrediting organizations), or</P>
                      <P>(iv) A nonprofit organization whose purposes are educational and include providing educational and instructional television material to such accredited institutions and governmental organizations.</P>
                      <P>(v) Other noncommercial entities with an educational mission.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Editorial control.</E> (i) A DBS operator will be required to make capacity available only to qualified programmers and may select among such programmers when demand exceeds the capacity of their reserved channels.</P>
                      <P>(ii) A DBS operator may not require the programmers it selects to include particular programming on its channels.</P>
                      <P>(iii) A DBS operator may not alter or censor the content of the programming provided by the qualified programmer using the channels reserved pursuant to this section.</P>
                      <P>(4) Non-commercial channel limitation. A DBS operator cannot initially select a qualified programmer to fill more than one of its reserved channels except that, after all qualified entities that have sought access have been offered access on at least one channel, a provider may allocate additional channels to qualified programmers without having to make additional efforts to secure other qualified programmers.</P>
                      <P>(5) <E T="03">Rates, terms and conditions.</E> (i) In making the required reserved capacity available, DBS providers cannot charge rates that exceed costs that are directly related to making the capacity available to qualified programmers. Direct costs include only the cost of transmitting the signal to the uplink facility and uplinking the signal to the satellite.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Rates for capacity reserved under paragraph (a) of this section shall not exceed 50 percent of the direct costs as defined in this section.</P>
                      <P>(iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit DBS providers from negotiating rates with qualified programmers that are less than 50 percent of direct costs or from paying qualified programmers for the use of their programming.</P>
                      <P>(iv) DBS providers shall reserve discrete channels and offer these to qualifying programmers at consistent times to fulfill the reservation requirement described in these rules.</P>
                      <P>(6) <E T="03">Public file.</E> (i) In addition to the political file requirements in § 25.701(d), each DBS provider shall keep and permit public inspection of a complete and orderly record of:</P>
                      <P>(A) Quarterly measurements of channel capacity and yearly average calculations on which it bases its four percent reservation, as well as its response to any capacity changes;</P>
                      <P>(B) A record of entities to whom noncommercial capacity is being provided, the amount of capacity being provided to each entity, the conditions under which it is being provided and the rates, if any, being paid by the entity;</P>
                      <P>(C) A record of entities that have requested capacity, disposition of those requests and reasons for the disposition.</P>
                      <P>(ii) All records required by this paragraph shall be placed in a file available to the public as soon as possible and shall be retained for a period of two years.</P>
                      <P>(7) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> DBS providers are required to make channel capacity available pursuant to this section upon the effective date. Programming provided pursuant to this rule must be available to the public no later than six months after the effective date.</P>

                        <P>No 125 kHz channels are provided for channels in operation in this service. The 125 kHz channels previously associated with these channels have been reallocated to Channel G3 in the upper band segment.</P>

                      <P>(3) During the transition (see §§ 27.1230-27.1239) EBS and BRS licensees may exchange channels to effectuate the transition of the 2.5 GHz band in a given BTA.</P>
                      <P>(4) A temporary fixed broadband station may use any available broadband channel on a secondary basis, except that operation of temporary fixed broadband stations is not allowed within 56.3 km (35 miles) of Canada.</P>
                      <P>(5)(i) A point-to-point EBS station on the E and F-channel frequencies, may be involuntarily displaced by a BRS applicant or licensee, provided that suitable alternative spectrum is available and that the BRS entity bears the expenses of the migration. Suitability of spectrum will be determined on a case-by-base basis; at a minimum, the alternative spectrum must be licensable by broadband operators on a primary basis (although it need not be specifically allocated to the broadband service), and must provide a signal that is equivalent to the prior signal in picture quality and reliability, unless the broadband licensee will accept an inferior signal. Potential expansion of the BRS licensee may be considered in determining whether alternative available spectrum is suitable.</P>
                      <P>(ii) If suitable alternative spectrum is located pursuant to paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section, the initiating party must prepare and file the appropriate application for the new spectrum, and must simultaneously serve a copy of the application on the EBS licensee to be moved. The initiating party will be responsible for all costs connected with the migration, including purchasing, testing and installing new equipment, labor costs, reconfiguration of existing equipment, administrative costs, legal and engineering expenses necessary to prepare and file the migration application, and other reasonable documented costs. The initiating party must secure a bond or establish an escrow account to cover reasonable incremental increase in ongoing expenses that may fall upon the migrated licensee. The bond or escrow account should also account for the possibility that the initiating party subsequently becomes bankrupt. If it becomes necessary for the Commission to assess the sufficiency of a bond or escrow amount, it will take into account such factors as projected incremental increase in electricity or maintenance expenses, or relocation expenses, as relevant in each case.</P>

                      <P>(iii) The EBS licensee to be moved will have a 60-day period in which to oppose the involuntary migration. The broadband party should state its opposition to the migration with specificity, including engineering and other challenges, and a comparison of the present site and the proposed new site. If involuntary migration is granted, the new facilities must be operational <PRTPAGE P="315"/>before the initiating party will be permitted to begin its new or modified operations. The migration must not disrupt the broadband licensee's provision of service, and the broadband licensee has the right to inspect the construction or installation work.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Construction requirements; Criteria for renewal.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) AWS and WCS licensees, with the exception of WCS licensees holding authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, Block C, C1, or C2 in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands, Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands, Block A in the 2305-2310 MHz and 2350-2355 MHz bands, Block B in the 2310-2315 MHz and 2355-2360 MHz bands, Block C in the 2315-2320 MHz band, and Block D in the 2345-2350 MHz band, must, as a performance requirement, make a showing of “substantial service” in their license area within the prescribed license term set forth in § 27.13. “Substantial service” is defined as service which is sound, favorable and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal. Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</P>

                      <P>(b) A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal expectancy, <PRTPAGE P="321"/>which is the most important comparative factor to be considered in the proceeding, if its past record for the relevant license period demonstrates that:</P>
                      <P>(1) The renewal applicant has provided “substantial” service during its past license term; and</P>
                      <P>(2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
                      <P>(c) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a WCS renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include:</P>
                      <P>(1) A description of its current service in terms of geographic coverage and population served;</P>
                      <P>(2) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable of new construction to meet changes in demand for service;</P>
                      <P>(3) A description of its investments in its WCS system; and</P>
                      <P>(4) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph.</P>
                      <P>(d) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification application is dismissed or denied.</P>
                      <P>(e) Comparative renewal proceedings do not apply to WCS licensees holding authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz, 728-734 MHz bands, Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, Block C in the 710-716 MHz and 740-746 MHz bands, Block D in the 716-722 MHz band, Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, Block C, C1, or C2 in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands, or Block D in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands. Each of these licensees must file a renewal application in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 1.949, and must make a showing of substantial service, independent of its performance requirements, as a condition for renewal at the end of each license term.</P>
                      <P>(f) Comparative renewal proceedings do not apply to WCS licensees holding authorizations for the 698-746 MHz, 747-762 MHz, and 777-792 MHz bands. These licensees must file a renewal application in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 1.949 of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(g) WCS licensees holding EA authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, cellular market authorizations for Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, or EA authorizations for Block E in the 722-728 MHz band, if the results of the first auction in which licenses for such authorizations are offered satisfy the reserve price for the applicable block, shall provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 35 percent of the geographic area of each of their license authorizations no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license grant if the initial authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), and shall provide such service over at least 70 percent of the geographic area of each of these authorizations by the end of the license term. In applying these geographic benchmarks, licensees are not required to include land owned or administered by government as a part of the relevant service area. Licensees may count covered government land for purposes of meeting their geographic construction benchmark, but are required to add the covered government land to the total geographic area used for measurement purposes. Licensees are required to include those populated lands held by tribal governments and those held by the Federal Government in trust or for the benefit of a recognized tribe.</P>

                      <P>(1) If an EA or CMA licensee holding an authorization in these particular blocks fails to provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 35 percent of the geographic area of its license authorization by no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license grant, if the initial authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), the term of that license authorization will be reduced by two years and such licensee may be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, an EA or CMA licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that <PRTPAGE P="322"/>is below this interim benchmark may lose authority to operate in part of the remaining unserved areas of the license.</P>
                      <P>(2) If any such EA or CMA licensee fails to provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 70 percent of the geographic area of its license authorization by the end of the license term, that licensee's authorization will terminate automatically without Commission action for those geographic portions of its license in which the licensee is not providing service, and those unserved areas will become available for reassignment by the Commission. Such licensee may also be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, an EA or CMA licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that is below this end-of-term benchmark may be subject to license termination. In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a license area terminates automatically without Commission action, such areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(3) For licenses under paragraph (g) of this section, the geographic service area to be made available for reassignment must include a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles), and areas smaller than a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles) will not be deemed unserved.</P>
                      <P>(h) WCS licensees holding REAG authorizations for Block C in the 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz bands or REAG authorizations for Block C2 in the 752-757 MHz and 782-787 MHz bands shall provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 40 percent of the population in each EA comprising the REAG license area no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license grant, if the initial authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), and shall provide such service over at least 75 percent of the population of each of these EAs by the end of the license term. For purposes of compliance with this requirement, licensees should determine population based on the most recently available U.S. Census Data.</P>
                      <P>(1) If a licensee holding a Block C authorization fails to provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 40 percent of the population in each EA comprising the REAG license area by no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license grant if the initial authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), the term of the license authorization will be reduced by two years and such licensee may be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, a licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that is below this interim benchmark may lose authority to operate in part of the remaining unserved areas of the license.</P>
                      <P>(2) If a licensee holding a Block C authorization fails to provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 75 percent of the population in any EA comprising the REAG license area by the end of the license term, for each such EA that licensee's authorization will terminate automatically without Commission action for those geographic portions of its license in which the licensee is not providing service. Such licensee may also be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a license area terminates automatically without Commission action, such areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section. In addition, a REAG licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that is below this end-of-term benchmark within any EA may be subject to license termination within that EA.</P>
                      <P>(3) For licenses under paragraph (h), the geographic service area to be made available for reassignment must include a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles), and areas smaller than a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles) will not be deemed unserved.</P>

                      <P>(i) WCS licensees holding EA authorizations for Block A in the 698-704 MHz and 728-734 MHz bands, cellular market authorizations for Block B in the 704-710 MHz and 734-740 MHz bands, or EA authorizations for Block E in the 722-<PRTPAGE P="323"/>728 MHz band, if the results of the first auction in which licenses for such authorizations in Blocks A, B, and E are offered do not satisfy the reserve price for the applicable block, as well as EA authorizations for Block C1 in the 746-752 MHz and 776-782 MHz bands, are subject to the following:</P>
                      <P>(1) If a licensee holding a cellular market area or EA authorization subject to this paragraph (i) fails to provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 40 percent of the population in its license area by no later than June 13, 2013 (or within four years of initial license grant, if the initial authorization in a market is granted after June 13, 2009), the term of that license authorization will be reduced by two years and such licensee may be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In addition, such licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that is below this interim benchmark may lose authority to operate in part of the remaining unserved areas of the license. For purposes of compliance with this requirement, licensees should determine population based on the most recently available U.S. Census Data.</P>
                      <P>(2) If a licensee holding a cellular market area or EA authorization subject to this paragraph (i) fails to provide signal coverage and offer service over at least 75 percent of the population in its license area by the end of the license term, that licensee's authorization will terminate automatically without Commission action for those geographic portions of its license in which the licensee is not providing service, and those unserved areas will become available for reassignment by the Commission. Such licensee may also be subject to enforcement action, including forfeitures. In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a license area terminates automatically without Commission action, such areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section. In addition, such a licensee that provides signal coverage and offers service at a level that is below this end-of-term benchmark may be subject to license termination. For purposes of compliance with this requirement, licensees should determine population based on the most recently available U.S. Census Data.</P>
                      <P>(3) For licenses under paragraph (i), the geographic service area to be made available for reassignment must include a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles), and areas smaller than a contiguous area of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles) will not be deemed unserved.</P>
                      <P>(j) In the event that a licensee's authority to operate in a license area terminates automatically under paragraphs (g), (h), or (i) of this section, such areas will become available for reassignment pursuant to the following procedures:</P>
                      <P>(1) The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau is delegated authority to announce by public notice that these license areas will be made available and establish a 30-day window during which third parties may file license applications to serve these areas. During this 30-day period, licensees that had their authority to operate terminate automatically for unserved areas may not file applications to provide service to these areas. Applications filed by third parties that propose areas overlapping with other applications will be deemed mutually exclusive, and will be resolved through an auction. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, by public notice, may specify a limited period before the filing of short-form applications (FCC Form 175) during which applicants may enter into a settlement to resolve their mutual exclusivity, subject to the provisions of § 1.935 of this chapter.</P>

                      <P>(2) Following this 30-day period, the original licensee and third parties can file license applications for remaining unserved areas where licenses have not been issued or for which there are no pending applications. If the original licensee or a third party files an application, that application will be placed on public notice for 30 days. If no mutually exclusive application is filed, the application will be granted, provided that a grant is found to be in the public interest. If a mutually exclusive application is filed, it will be resolved <PRTPAGE P="324"/>through an auction. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, by public notice, may specify a limited period before the filing of short-form applications (FCC Form 175) during which applicants may enter into a settlement to resolve their mutual exclusivity, subject to the provisions of § 1.935 of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(3) The licensee will have one year from the date the new license is issued to complete its construction and provide signal coverage and offer service over 100 percent of the geographic area of the new license area. If the licensee fails to meet this construction requirement, its license will automatically terminate without Commission action and it will not be eligible to apply to provide service to this area at any future date.</P>
                      <P>(k) WCS licensees holding authorizations in the spectrum blocks enumerated in paragraphs (g), (h), or (i), including any licensee that obtained its license pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (j), shall demonstrate compliance with performance requirements by filing a construction notification with the Commission, within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable benchmark, in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 1.946(d). The licensee must certify whether it has met the applicable performance requirements. The licensee must file a description and certification of the areas for which it is providing service. The construction notifications must include electronic coverage maps, supporting technical documentation and any other information as the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau may prescribe by public notice.</P>
                      <P>(l) WCS licensees holding authorizations in the spectrum blocks enumerated in paragraphs (g), (h), or (i) of this section, excluding any licensee that obtained its license pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (j) of this section, shall file reports with the Commission that provide the Commission, at a minimum, with information concerning the status of their efforts to meet the performance requirements applicable to their authorizations in such spectrum blocks and the manner in which that spectrum is being utilized. The information to be reported will include the date the license term commenced, a description of the steps the licensee has taken toward meeting its construction obligations in a timely manner, including the technology or technologies and service(s) being provided, and the areas within the license area in which those services are available. Each of these licensees shall file its first report with the Commission no later than June 13, 2011 and no sooner than 30 days prior to this date. Each licensee that meets its interim benchmarks shall file a second report with the Commission no later than June 13, 2016 and no sooner than 30 days prior to this date. Each licensee that does not meet its interim benchmark shall file this second report no later than on June 13, 2015 and no sooner than 30 days prior to this date.</P>
                      <P>(m) The WCS licensee holding the authorization for the D Block in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands (the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee) shall comply with the following construction requirements.</P>
                      <P>(1) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall provide a signal coverage and offer service over at least 75 percent of the population of the nationwide Upper 700 MHz D Block license area within four years from June 13, 2009, 95 percent of the population of the nationwide license area within seven years, and 99.3 percent of the population of the nationwide license area within ten years.</P>
                      <P>(2) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may modify, to a limited degree, its population-based construction benchmarks with the agreement of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the prior approval of the Commission, where such a modification would better serve to meet commercial and public safety needs.</P>

                      <P>(3) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall meet the population benchmarks based on a performance schedule specified in the Network Sharing Agreement, taking into account performance pursuant to § 27.1327 as appropriate under that rule, and using the most recently available U.S. Census Data. The network and signal levels employed to meet these benchmarks must be adequate for public safety use, as defined in the Network <PRTPAGE P="325"/>Sharing Agreement, and the services made available must include those appropriate for public safety entities that operate in those areas. The schedule shall include coverage for major highways and interstates, as well as such additional areas that are necessary to provide coverage for all incorporated communities with a population in excess of 3,000, unless the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee jointly determine, in consultation with a relevant community, that such additional coverage will not provide significant public benefit.</P>
                      <P>(4) The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee shall demonstrate compliance with performance requirements by filing a construction notification with the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable benchmark, in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 1.946(d) of this chapter. The licensee must certify whether it has met the applicable performance requirement and must file a description and certification of the areas for which it is providing service. The construction notifications must include the following:</P>
                      <P>(i) Certifications of the areas that were scheduled for construction and service by that date under the Network Sharing Agreement for which it is providing service, the type of service it is providing for each area, and the type of technology it is utilizing to provide this service.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Electronic coverage maps and supporting technical documentation providing the assumptions used by the licensee to create the coverage maps, including the propagation model and the signal strength necessary to provide service.</P>
                      <P>(n) At the end of its license term, the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee must, in order to renew its license, make a showing of its success in meeting the material requirements set forth in the Network Sharing Agreement as well as all other license conditions, including the performance benchmark requirements set forth in this section.</P>
                      <P>(o) BRS and EBS licensees originally issued a BRS or EBS license prior to November 6, 2009 must make a showing of substantial service no later than May 1, 2011. With respect to initial BRS licenses issued on or after November 6, 2009, the licensee must make a showing of substantial service within four years from the date of issue of the license. Incumbent BRS licensees that are required to demonstrate substantial service by May 1, 2011 must file their substantial service showings with their renewal applications. “Substantial service” is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal. Substantial service for BRS and EBS licensees is satisfied if a licensee meets the requirements of paragraph (o)(1), (o)(2), or (o)(3) of this section. If a licensee has not met the requirements of paragraph (o)(1), (o)(2), or (o)(3) of this section, then demonstration of substantial service shall proceed on a case-by-case basis. Except as provided in paragraphs (o)(4) and (o)(5) of this section, all substantial service determinations will be made on a license-by-license basis. Failure by any licensee to demonstrate substantial service will result in forfeiture of the license and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</P>
                      <P>(1) A BRS or EBS licensee has provided “substantial service” by:</P>
                      <P>(i) Constructing six permanent links per one million people for licensees providing fixed point-to-point services;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Providing coverage of at least 30 percent of the population of the licensed area for licensees providing mobile services or fixed point-to-multipoint services;</P>
                      <P>(iii) Providing service to “rural areas” (a county (or equivalent) with a population density of 100 persons per square mile or less, based upon the most recently available Census data) and areas with limited access to telecommunications services:</P>
                      <P>(A) For mobile service, where coverage is provided to at least 75% of the geographic area of at least 30% of the rural areas within its service area; or</P>
                      <P>(B) for fixed service, where the BRS or EBS licensee has constructed at least one end of a permanent link in at least 30% of the rural areas within its licensed area.</P>

                      <P>(iv) Providing specialized or technologically sophisticated service that <PRTPAGE P="326"/>does not require a high level of coverage to benefit consumers; or</P>
                      <P>(v) Providing service to niche markets or areas outside the areas served by other licensees.</P>
                      <P>(2) An EBS licensee has provided “substantial service” when:</P>
                      <P>(i) The EBS licensee is using its spectrum (or spectrum to which the EBS licensee's educational services are shifted) to provide educational services within the EBS licensee's GSA;</P>
                      <P>(ii) the EBS licensee's license is actually being used to serve the educational mission of one or more accredited public or private schools, colleges or universities providing formal educational and cultural development to enrolled students; or</P>
                      <P>(iii) the level of service provided by the EBS licensee meets or exceeds the minimum usage requirements specified in § 27.1214.</P>
                      <P>(3) An EBS or BRS licensee may be deemed to provide substantial service through a leasing arrangement if the lessee is providing substantial service under paragraph (o)(1) of this section. The EBS licensee must also be otherwise in compliance with this Chapter (including the programming requirements in § 27.1203 of this subpart).</P>
                      <P>(4) If the GSA of a licensee is less than 1924 square miles in size, and there is an overlapping co-channel station licensed or leased by the licensee or its affiliate, substantial service may be demonstrated by meeting the requirements of paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section with respect to the combined GSAs of both stations.</P>
                      <P>(5) If the GSA of a BTA authorization holder, is less than one-half of the area within the BTA for every BRS channel, substantial service may be demonstrated for the licenses in question by meeting the requirements of paragraph (o)(1) or (o)(2) of this section with respect to the combined GSAs of the BTA authorization holder, together with any incumbent authorizations licensed or leased by the licensee or its affiliates.</P>
                      <P>(p) This section enumerates performance requirements for licensees holding authorizations for Block A in the 2305-2310 MHz and 2350-2355 MHz bands, Block B in the 2310-2315 MHz and 2355-2360 MHz bands, Block C in the 2315-2320 MHz band, and Block D in the 2345-2350 MHz band.</P>
                      <P>(1) For mobile or point-to-multipoint systems, a licensee must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40 percent of the license area's population by March 4, 2014, and to at least 75 percent of the license area's population by September 1, 2016. If, when filing the construction notification required under § 1.946(d) of this chapter, a WCS licensee demonstrates that 25 percent or more of the license area's population for Block A, B or D is within a coordination zone as defined by § 27.73(a) of the rules, the foregoing population benchmarks are reduced to 25 and 50 percent, respectively. The percentage of a license area's population within a coordination zone equals the sum of the Census Block Centroid Populations within the area, divided by the license area's total population.</P>
                      <P>(2) For point-to-point fixed systems, except those deployed in the Gulf of Mexico license area, a licensee must construct and operate a minimum of 15 point-to-point links per million persons (one link per 67,000 persons) in a license area by March 4, 2014, and 30 point-to-point links per million persons (one link per 33,500 persons) in a licensed area by September 1, 2016. The exact link requirement is calculated by dividing a license area's total population by 67,000 and 33,500 for the respective milestones, and then rounding upwards to the next whole number. For a link to be counted towards these benchmarks, both of its endpoints must be located in the license area. If only one endpoint of a link is located in a license area, it can be counted as a one- half link towards the benchmarks.</P>
                      <P>(3) For point-to-point fixed systems deployed on any spectrum block in the Gulf of Mexico license area, a licensee must construct and operate a minimum of 15 point-to-point links by March 4, 2014, and a minimum of 15 point-to-point links by September 1, 2016.</P>

                      <P>(4) Under paragraph (p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section, each fixed link must provide a minimum bit rate, in bits per second, equal to or greater than the bandwidth specified by the emission <PRTPAGE P="327"/>designator in Hertz (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> equipment transmitting at a 5 Mb/s rate must not require a bandwidth of greater than 5 MHz).</P>
                      <P>(5) If an initial authorization for a license area is granted after September 1, 2010, then the applicable benchmarks in paragraphs (p)(1), (p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section must be met within 42 and 72 months, respectively, of the initial authorization grant date.</P>
                      <P>(6) Licensees must use the most recently available U.S. Census Data at the time of measurement to meet these performance requirements.</P>
                      <P>(7) Licensees must certify compliance with the applicable performance requirements by filing a construction notification with the Commission, within 15 days of the expiration of the relevant performance milestone, pursuant to § 1.946(d) of this chapter. Each construction notification must include electronic coverage maps, supporting technical documentation, and any other information as the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau may prescribe by public notice. Electronic coverage maps must accurately depict the boundaries of each license area (Regional Economic Area Grouping, REAG, or Major Economic Area, MEA) in the licensee's service territory. Further, REAG maps must depict MEA boundaries and MEA maps must depict Economic Area boundaries. If a licensee does not provide reliable signal coverage to an entire license area, its map must accurately depict the boundaries of the area or areas within each license area not being served. Each licensee also must file supporting documentation certifying the type of service it is providing for each REAG or MEA within its service territory and the type of technology used to provide such service. Supporting documentation must include the assumptions used to create the coverage maps, including the propagation model and the signal strength necessary to provide reliable service with the licensee's technology.</P>
                      <P>(8) If a licensee fails to meet any applicable performance requirement, its authorization will terminate automatically without further Commission action as of the applicable performance milestone and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.</P>

                      <P>(1) Standards shall include technical requirements reasonably necessary for third parties to access a licensee's network via devices or applications without causing objectionable interference to other spectrum users or jeopardizing network security. The potential for excessive bandwidth demand alone shall not constitute grounds for denying, limiting or restricting access to the network.</P>
                      <P>(2) To the extent a licensee relies on standards established by an independent standards-setting body which is open to participation by representatives of service providers, equipment manufacturers, application developers, consumer organizations, and other interested parties, the standards will carry a presumption of reasonableness.</P>
                      <P>(3) A licensee shall publish its technical standards, which shall be non-proprietary, no later than the time at which it makes such standards available to any preferred vendors, so that the standards are readily available to customers, equipment manufacturers, application developers, and other parties interested in using or developing products for use on a licensee's networks.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Access requests.</E> (1) Licensees shall establish and publish clear and reasonable procedures for parties to seek approval to use devices or applications on the licensees' networks. A licensee must also provide to potential customers notice of the customers' rights to request the attachment of a device or application to the licensee's network, and notice of the licensee's process for customers to make such requests, including the relevant network criteria.</P>
                      <P>(2) If a licensee determines that a request for access would violate its technical standards or regulatory requirements, the licensee shall expeditiously provide a written response to the requester specifying the basis for denying access and providing an opportunity for the requester to modify its request to satisfy the licensee's concerns.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Handset locking prohibited.</E> No licensee may disable features on handsets it provides to customers, to the extent such features are compliant with the licensee's standards pursuant to paragraph (b)of this section, nor configure handsets it provides to prohibit use of such handsets on other providers' networks.<PRTPAGE P="330"/>

Where the licensee bases its network restrictions on industry-wide consensus standards, such restrictions would be presumed reasonable.</P>

Thus, for example, if the license authorization is granted during the April-June quarter of 2008, the licensee must file its first report by July 10, 2008. Each quarterly report, either paper or electronic, must be filed with the Commission in Docket Number 07-148. If the quarterly report is a paper filing, the cover sheet must clearly state “Report,” whereas if the report is filed electronically using the Commission's Electronic Comment File System (ECFS), the “Document Type” on the cover sheet should indicate “REPORT.”</P>
                      <P>(c) The reporting requirements under this section cover the remaining period of the DTV transition. Accordingly, once the licensee files its quarterly report covering the second quarter of 2009, the requirements of this section terminate.</P>

                      <P>(4) For main, booster and response stations utilizing digital emissions with non-uniform power spectral density (<E T="03">e.g.</E> unfiltered QPSK), the power measured within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within the 6 MHz channel occupied by the non-uniform emission cannot exceed the power permitted within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within the 6 MHz channel if it were occupied by an emission with uniform power spectral density, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, if the maximum permissible power of a station utilizing a perfectly uniform power spectral density across a 6 MHz channel were 2000 watts EIRP, this would result in a maximum permissible power flux density for the station of 2000/60 = 33.3 watts EIRP per 100 kHz bandwidth. If a non-uniform emission were substituted at the station, station power would still be limited to a maximum of 33.3 watts EIRP within any 100 kHz segment of the 6 MHz channel, irrespective of the fact that this would result in a total 6 MHz channel power of less than 2000 watts EIRP.</P>
                      <P>(i) Peak transmit power shall be measured over any interval of continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth, etc., so as to obtain a true peak measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the channel.</P>

                      <P>(5) <E T="03">Measurement procedure.</E> Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1-MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the channel blocks at 2305, 2310, 2315, 2320, 2345, 2350, 2355, and 2360 MHz, a resolution bandwidth of at least 1 percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (<E T="03">i.e.</E> 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power. With respect to television operations, measurements must be made of the separate visual and aural operating powers at sufficiently frequent intervals to ensure compliance with the rules.</P>

                      <P>(7) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as the transmitter power;</P>
                      <P>(8) Waiver requests of any of the out-of-band emission limits in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section shall be entertained only if interference protection equivalent to that afforded by the limits is shown;</P>

                      <P>(7) <E T="03">ACP measurement procedure.</E> The following procedures are to be followed for making ACP transmitter measurements. For time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, the measurements are to be made under TDMA operation only during time slots when the transmitter is on. All measurements must be made at the input to the transmitter's antenna. Measurement bandwidth used below implies an instrument that measures the power in many narrow bandwidths (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 300 Hz) and integrates these powers across a larger band to determine power in the measurement bandwidth.</P>
                      <P>(i) <E T="03">Setting reference level.</E> Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth to the channel size. For example, for a 6.25 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to 6.25 kHz; for a 150 kHz transmitter, set the measurement bandwidth to 150 kHz. Set the frequency offset of the measurement bandwidth to zero and adjust the center frequency of the spectrum analyzer to give the power level in the measurement bandwidth. Record this power level in dBm as the “reference power level”.</P>
                      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-swept power measurement.</E> Using a spectrum analyzer capable of ACP measurements, set the measurement bandwidth as shown in the tables above. Measure the ACP in dBm. These measurements should be made at maximum power. Calculate the coupled power by subtracting the measurements made in this step from the reference power measured in the previous step. The absolute ACP values must be less than the values given in the table for each condition above.</P>
                      <P>(iii) <E T="03">Swept power measurement.</E> Set a spectrum analyzer to 30 kHz resolution bandwidth, 1 MHz video bandwidth and sample mode detection. Sweep ±MHz from the carrier frequency. Set the reference level to the RMS value of the transmitter power and note the absolute power. The response at frequencies greater than 600 kHz must be less than the values in the tables above.</P>
                      <P>(8) <E T="03">Out-of-band emission limit.</E> On any frequency outside of the frequency ranges covered by the ACP tables in this section, the power of any emission must be reduced below the unmodulated carrier power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.</P>
                      <P>(9) <E T="03">Authorized bandwidth.</E> Provided that the ACP requirements of this section are met, applicants may request any authorized bandwidth that does not exceed the channel size.</P>
                      <P>(f) For operations in the 746-763 MHz, 775-793 MHz, and 805-806 MHz bands, emissions in the band 1559-1610 MHz shall be limited to −70 dBW/MHz equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) for wideband signals, and −80 dBW EIRP for discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz bandwidth. For the purpose of equipment authorization, a transmitter shall be tested with an antenna that is representative of the type that will be used with the equipment in normal operation.</P>

                      <P>(g) For operations in the 698-746 MHz band, the power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) within the licensed band(s) of operation, measured in watts, by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 100 kilohertz or greater. However, in the 100 kilohertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to a licensee's frequency block, a resolution bandwidth of at least 30 kHz may be employed.<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
                      </P>

                      <P>(h) For operations in the 1710-1755 MHz and 2110-2155 MHz bands, the power of any emission outside a licensee's frequency block shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log<E T="52">10</E> (P) dB.</P>
                      <P>(1) Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater. However, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the licensee's frequency block, a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.</P>
                      <P>(2) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier frequency shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's frequency block edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.</P>
                      <P>(3) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or average values, provided they are expressed in the same parameters as the transmitter power.</P>
                      <P>(i) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.</P>
                      <P>(j) For operations in the unpaired 1390-1392 MHz band and the paired 1392-1395 MHz and 1432-1435 MHz bands, the power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. Compliance with these provisions is based on the procedures described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(k) For operations in the 1670-1675 MHz band, the power of any emission outside the licensee's frequency band(s) of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB. Compliance with these provisions is based on the procedures described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(l) [Reserved]</P>
                      <P>(m) For BRS and EBS stations, the power of any emissions outside the licensee's frequency bands of operation shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) measured in watts in accordance with the standards below. If a licensee has multiple contiguous channels, out-of-band emissions shall be measured from the upper and lower edges of the contiguous channels.</P>
                      <P>(1) Prior to the transition, and thereafter, solely within the MBS, for analog operations with an EIRP in excess of −9 dBW, the signal shall be attenuated at the channel edges by at least 38 dB relative to the peak visual carrier, then linearly sloping from that level to at least 60 dB of attenuation at 1 MHz below the lower band edge and 0.5 MHz above the upper band edge, and attenuated at least 60 dB at all other frequencies.</P>
                      <P>(2) For digital base stations, the attenuation shall be not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB, unless a documented interference complaint is received from an adjacent channel licensee with an overlapping Geographic Service Area. Mobile Satellite Service licensees operating on frequencies below 2495 MHz may also submit a documented interference complaint against BRS licensees operating on channel BRS No. 1 on the same terms and conditions as adjacent channel BRS or EBS licensees. Provided that a documented interference complaint cannot be mutually resolved between the parties prior to the applicable deadline, then the following additional attenuation requirements shall apply:</P>

                      <P>(i) If a pre-existing base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a new or modified base station located 1.5 km or more away, within 24 hours of the receipt of a documented interference complaint the licensee of the new or modified base station must attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block and shall immediately notify the complaining licensee upon implementation of the additional attenuation. No later than 60 days after the implementation of such additional attenuation, the licensee of the complaining base station <PRTPAGE P="343"/>must attenuate its base station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block of the new or modified base station.</P>
                      <P>(ii) If a pre-existing base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a new or modified base station located less than 1.5 km away, within 24 hours of receipt of a documented interference complaint the licensee of the new or modified base station must attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P)−20 log (Dkm/1.5) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block of the complaining licensee, or if both base stations are co-located, limit its undesired signal level at the pre-existing base station receiver(s) to no more than −107 dBm measured in a 5.5 megahertz bandwidth and shall immediately notify the complaining licensee upon such reduction in the undesired signal level. No later than 60 days after such reduction in the undesired signal level, the complaining licensee must attenuate its base station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block of the new or modified base station.</P>
                      <P>(iii) If a new or modified base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a pre-existing base station located 1.5 km or more away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented interference complaint the licensee of each base station must attenuate its base station emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block of the other licensee.</P>
                      <P>(iv) If a new or modified base station suffers harmful interference from emissions caused by a pre-existing base station located less than 1.5 km away, within 60 days of receipt of a documented interference complaint: (a) The licensee of the new or modified base station must attenuate its OOBE by at least 67 + 10 log (P)−20 log (Dkm/1.5) measured 3 megahertz above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block of the other licensee, or if the base stations are co-located, limit its undesired signal level at the other base station receiver(s) to no more than −107 dBm measured in a 5.5-megahertz bandwidth; and (b) the licensee causing the interference must attenuate its emissions by at least 67 + 10 log (P) dB measured at 3 megahertz, above or below, from the channel edge of its frequency block of the new or modified base station.</P>
                      <P>(v) For all fixed digital user stations, the attenuation factor shall be not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at the channel edge.</P>
                      <P>(3) Prior to transition and thereafter solely within the MBS, and notwithstanding paragraph (l)(2) of this section, the maximum out-of-band power of a digital transmitter operating on a single 6 MHz channel with an EIRP in excess of −9 dBW employing digital modulation for the primary purpose of transmitting video programming shall be attenuated at the 6 MHz channel edges at least 25 dB relative to the licensed average 6 MHz channel power level, then attenuated along a linear slope to at least 40 dB at 250 kHz beyond the nearest channel edge, then attenuated along a linear slope from that level to at least 60 dB at 3 MHz above the upper and below the lower licensed channel edges, and attenuated at least 60 dB at all other frequencies.</P>
                      <P>(4) For mobile digital stations, the attenuation factor shall be not less than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at the channel edge and 55 + 10 log (P) dB at 5.5 megahertz from the channel edges. Mobile Satellite Service licensees operating on frequencies below 2495 MHz may also submit a documented interference complaint against BRS licensees operating on BRS Channel 1 on the same terms and conditions as adjacent channel BRS or EBS licensees.</P>
                      <P>(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (l)(2) and (l)(4) of this section, prior to transition, a licensee may continue to operate facilities deployed as of January 10, 2005 provided that such facilities operate in compliance with the emission mask applicable to those services prior to January 10, 2005.</P>

                      <P>(6) Measurement procedure. Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 <PRTPAGE P="344"/>MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth (<E T="03">i.e.</E> 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power. With respect to television operations, measurements must be made of the separate visual and aural operating powers at sufficiently frequent intervals to ensure compliance with the rules.</P>
                      <P>(7) Alternative out of band emission limit. Licensees in this service may establish an alternative out of band emission limit to be used at specified band edge(s) in specified geographical areas, in lieu of that set forth in this section, pursuant to a private contractual arrangement of all affected licensees and applicants. In this event, each party to such contract shall maintain a copy of the contract in their station files and disclose it to prospective assignees or transferees and, upon request, to the FCC.</P>
                      <P>(n) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.</P>

                      <P>(iv) Obtain written concurrence from the applicable TV/DTV station(s). If this method is chosen, a copy of the agreement must be submitted with the application.</P>

                      <P>(2) The following is the method for geographic separations. (i) Base and fixed stations that operate in the 746-763 MHz, 775-787 MHz, and 788-793 MHz bands having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB protection) in § 90.309 of this chapter. Base and fixed stations that operate in the 698-746 MHz band having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) shall afford protection to adjacent channel DTV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table E in § 90.309 of this chapter, shall afford protection to co-channel DTV stations by providing 23 dB protection to such stations' equivalent Grade B contour (41 dBµV/m), and shall afford protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV stations in accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB protection) in § 90.309 of this chapter. For base and fixed stations having an antenna height (HAAT) between 152-914 meters (500-3,000 ft.) the effective radiated power must be reduced below 1 kilowatt in accordance with the values shown in the power reduction graph in Figure B in § 90.309 of this chapter. For heights of more than 152 m. (500 ft.) above average terrain, the distance to the radio path horizon will be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the distance so determined equals or exceeds the distance to the hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of a co-channel TV/DTV station (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, it exceeds the distance from the appropriate Table in § 90.309 of this chapter to the relevant TV/DTV station), an authorization will not be granted unless it can be shown in an engineering study (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dBµV/m for TV and 41 dBµV/m for DTV stations) or unless the effective radiated power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space attenuation, the desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dBµV/m for TV and 41 dBµV/m coverage contour for DTV stations) will be achieved. Directions for calculating powers, heights, and reduction curves are listed in § 90.309 of this chapter for land mobile stations. Directions for <PRTPAGE P="348"/>calculating coverage contours are listed in § 73.683 through 73.685 of this chapter for TV stations and in § 73.625 of this chapter for DTV stations.</P>

                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Sites and frequency</E> selections. WCS licensees must select base station sites and frequencies, to the extent practicable, to minimize the possibility of harmful interference to operations in the SDARS 2320-2345 MHz band.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Prior notice periods.</E> WCS licensees that intend to operate a base station must, before commencing such operation, provide 10 business days prior notice to all SDARS licensees. WCS licensees that intend to modify an existing base station must, before commencing such modified operation, provide 5 business days prior notice to all SDARS licensees. For the purposes of this section, a business day is defined by § 1.4(e)(2) of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> (1) Notification must be written (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> certified letter, fax, or e-mail) and include the licensee's name, and the name, address, and telephone number of its coordination representative, unless the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected WCS licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some other means. WCS licensees and SDARS licensees may establish such a mutually agreeable alternative notification mechanism without prior Commission approval, provided that they comply with all other requirements of this section.</P>
                      <P>(2) Regardless of the notification method, it must specify relevant technical details, including, at a minimum:</P>
                      <P>(i) The coordinates of the proposed base station to an accuracy of no less than ± 1 second latitude and longitude;</P>
                      <P>(ii) The proposed operating power(s), frequency band(s), and emission(s);</P>

                      <P>(iii) The antenna center height above ground and ground elevation above <PRTPAGE P="351"/>mean sea level, both to an accuracy of no less than ± 1 meter;</P>

                      <P>(3) A WCS licensee operating base stations must maintain an accurate and up-to-date inventory of its base stations, including the information set forth in § 27.72(c)(2), which shall be available upon request by the Commission.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculation of notice period.</E> Notice periods are calculated from the date of receipt by the licensee being notified. If notification is by mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by the return receipt on certified mail. If notification is by fax, the date of receipt is evidenced by the notifying party's fax transmission confirmation log. If notification is by e-mail, the date of receipt is evidenced by a return e-mail receipt. If the SDARS licensee and all potentially affected WCS licensees reach a mutual agreement to provide notification by some other means, that agreement must specify the method for determining the beginning of the notice period.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Duty to cooperate.</E> WCS licensees must cooperate in good faith in the selection and use of new station sites and new frequencies to reduce interference and make the most effective use of the authorized facilities. WCS licensees should provide SDARS licensees as much lead time as practicable to provide ample time to conduct analyses and opportunity for prudent base station site selection prior to WCS licensees entering into real estate and tower leasing or purchasing agreements. WCS licensees must have sufficient operational flexibility in their network design to implement one or more technical solutions to remedy harmful interference. Licensees of stations suffering or causing harmful interference must cooperate in good faith and resolve such problems by mutually satisfactory arrangements. If the licensees are unable to do so, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, in consultation with the Office of Engineering and Technology and the International Bureau, will consider the actions taken by the parties to mitigate the risk of and remedy any alleged interference. In determining the appropriate action, the Bureau will take into account the nature and extent of the interference and act promptly to remedy the interference. The Bureau may impose restrictions on WCS licensees, including specifying the transmitter power, antenna height, or other technical or operational measures to remedy the interference, and will take into account previous measures by the licensees to mitigate the risk of interference.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Upper 700 MHz commercial and public safety coordination zone.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> CMRS operators are required, prior to commencing operations on fixed or base station transmitters on the 776-787 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands that are located within 500 meters of existing or planned public safety base station receivers, to submit a description of their proposed facility to a Commission-approved public safety coordinator.</P>
                      <P>(1) The description must include, at a minimum;</P>
                      <P>(i) The frequency or frequencies on which the facility will operate;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Antenna location and height;</P>
                      <P>(iii) Type of emission;</P>
                      <P>(iv) Effective radiated power;</P>
                      <P>(v) A description of the area served and the operator's name.</P>
                      <P>(2) It is the CMRS operator's responsibility to determine whether referral is required for stations constructed in its area of license. Public safety base stations are considered “planned” when public safety operators have notified, or initiated coordination with, a Commission-approved public safety coordinator.</P>
                      <P>(b) CMRS operators must wait at least 10 business days after submission of the required description before commencing operations on the referenced facility, or implementing modifications to an existing facility.</P>
                      <P>(c) The potential for harmful interference between the CMRS and public safety facilities will be evaluated by the public safety coordinator.</P>
                      <P>(1) With regard to existing public safety facilities, the coordinator's determination to disapprove a proposed CMRS facility (or modification) to be located within 500 meters of the public safety facilities will be presumed correct, but the CMRS operator may seek Commission review of such determinations. Pending Commission review, the CMRS operator will not activate the facility or implement proposed modifications.</P>
                      <P>(2) With regard to proposed public safety facilities, the coordinator's determination to disapprove a proposed CMRS facility (or modification) to be located within 500 meters of the public safety facilities will be presumed correct, but the CMRS operator may seek Commission review and, pending completion of review, operate the facility during construction of the public safety facilities. If coordination or Commission review has not been completed when the public safety facilities are ready to operate, the CMRS operator must cease operations pending completion of coordination or Commission review. Such interim operation of the CMRS facility within the coordination zone (or implementation of modifications) will not be relied on by the Commission in its subsequent review and determination of measures necessary to control interference, including relocation or modification of the CMRS facility.</P>
                      <P>(d) If, in the event of harmful interference between facilities located within 500 meters proximity, the parties are unable, with the involvement of the coordinator, to resolve the problem by mutually satisfactory arrangements, the Commission may impose restrictions on the operations of any of the parties involved.</P>

AWS licensees must accept any interference received from these facilities and must protect the facilities from interference. AWS licensees shall protect the facilities from interference by restricting the operation of their base and fixed stations from any locations that could potentially permit AWS mobile, fixed, and portable stations transmitting in the 1710-1755 MHz band to cause interference to government operations within the radii of operation of the 16 facilities (the radii of operation of each facility is indicated in the third column of Table 1 immediately following paragraph (a)(3) of this section). In addition, AWS licensees shall be required to coordinate any operations that could permit mobile, fixed, and portable stations to operate in the specified areas of the 16 facilities, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Protection of these facilities in this manner shall take place under the following conditions:</P>
                        <P>(1) At the Yuma, Arizona and Cherry Point, North Carolina facilities, all operations shall be protected indefinitely.</P>
                        <P>(2) At the remaining 14 facilities, airborne and military test range operations shall be protected until such time as these systems are relocated to other spectrum, and precision guided munitions (PGM) operations shall be protected until such time as these systems are relocated to other spectrum or until PGM inventory at each facility is exhausted, whichever occurs first.</P>

                        <P>(3) AWS licensees whose transmit operations in the 1710-1755 MHz band consist of fixed or mobile operations with nominal transmit EIRP values of 100 <PRTPAGE P="360"/>mW or less and antenna heights of 1.6 meters above ground or less shall coordinate their services around the 16 sites at the distance specified in row a. of Table 2.

These coordination distances shall be measured from the edge of the operational distances indicated in the third column of Table 1, and coordination with each affected DoD facility shall be accomplished through the Commander of the facility.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Cost-sharing requirements for AWS.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>Frequencies in the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2180 MHz bands listed in § 101.147 of this chapter have been reallocated from Fixed Microwave Services (FMS) to use by AWS (as reflected in § 2.106) of this chapter. In accordance with procedures specified in § 22.602 and §§ 101.69 through 101.82 of this chapter, AWS entities are required to relocate the existing microwave licensees in these bands if interference to the existing microwave licensee would occur. All AWS entities that benefit from the clearance of this spectrum by other AWS entities or by a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must contribute to such relocation costs. AWS entities may satisfy their reimbursement requirement by entering into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than those specified in § 27.1164. However, AWS entities are required to reimburse other AWS entities or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbents that incur relocation costs and are not parties to the alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a private cost-sharing agreement may seek reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed in § 27.1162) from AWS entities or other Emerging Technologies (ET) entities, including Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) operators (for Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) base stations), that are not parties to the agreement. The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all phases of microwave relocation specified in §§ 22.602 and 101.69 of this chapter. If an AWS licensee enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement (as set forth in part 1, subpart X of this chapter) and the spectrum lessee triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee is the AWS entity responsible for satisfying the cost-sharing obligations under §§ 27.1160-27.1174.</P>

                        <P>The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, under delegated authority, will select one or more entities to operate as a neutral, not-for-profit clearinghouse(s). This clearinghouse(s) will administer the cost-sharing plan by, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> determining the cost-sharing obligation of AWS and other ET entities for the relocation of FMS incumbents from the 2110-2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands. The clearinghouse filing requirements (see §§ 27.1166(a), 27.1170) will not take effect until an administrator is selected.</P>

                        <P>An AWS relocator who relocates an interfering microwave link, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, one that is in all or part of its market area and in all or part of its frequency band or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, is entitled to <E T="03">pro rata</E> reimbursement based on the following formula:

                          <E T="54">N</E> equals the amount of reimbursement.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">C</E> equals the actual cost of relocating the link(s). Actual relocation costs include, but are not limited to, such items as: Radio terminal equipment (TX and/or RX—antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; prior coordination notification under § 101.103(d) of this chapter; site lease renegotiation; required antenna upgrades for interference control; power plant upgrade (if required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport equipment; and leased facilities. Increased recurring costs represent part of the actual cost of relocation and, even if the compensation to the incumbent is in the form of a commitment to pay five years of charges, the AWS or MSS/ATC relocator is entitled to seek immediate reimbursement of the lump sum amount based on present value using current interest rates, provided it has entered into a legally binding agreement to pay the charges. <E T="03">C</E> also includes voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent's independent third party appraisal of its compensable relocation costs and incumbent transaction expenses that are directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the “hard” costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and engineering expenses. <E T="03">C</E> may not exceed $250,000 per paired link, with an additional $150,000 permitted if a new or modified tower is required.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">N</E> equals the number of AWS and MSS/ATC entities that have triggered a cost-sharing obligation. For the AWS relocator, <E T="03">N</E>=1. For the next AWS entity triggering a cost-sharing obligation, <E T="03">N</E>=2, and so on. In the case of a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, <E T="03">N</E>=1 for the first AWS entity triggering a cost-sharing obligation. For the next AWS or MSS/ATC entity triggering a cost-sharing obligation, <E T="03">N</E>=2, and so on.</P>

                          <E T="54">m</E> equals the number of months that have elapsed between the month the AWS or MSS/ATC relocator or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent obtains reimbursement rights for the link and the month in which an AWS entity triggers a cost-sharing obligation. An AWS or MSS/ATC relocator obtains reimbursement rights for the link on the date that it signs a relocation agreement with a microwave incumbent. A voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent obtains reimbursement rights for the link on the date that the incumbent notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to § 101.305 of the Commission's rules.</P>

                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Registration of reimbursement rights</E>. Claims for reimbursement under the cost-sharing plan are limited to relocation expenses incurred on or after the date when the first AWS license is <PRTPAGE P="363"/>issued in the relevant AWS band (start date). If a clearinghouse is not selected by that date (see § 27.1162) claims for reimbursement (see § 27.1166) and notices of operation (see § 27.1170) for activities that occurred after the start date but prior to the clearinghouse selection must be submitted to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the selection date.</P>
                        <P>(1) To obtain reimbursement, an AWS relocator or MSS/ATC relocator must submit documentation of the relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent. In the case of involuntary relocation, an AWS relocator or MSS/ATC relocator must submit documentation of the relocated system within 30 calendar days after the end of the relocation.</P>
                        <P>(2) To obtain reimbursement, a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must submit documentation of the relocation of the link to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date that the incumbent notifies the Commission that it intends to discontinue, or has discontinued, the use of the link, pursuant to § 101.305 of the Commission's rules.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation of expenses</E>. Once relocation occurs, the AWS relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items specifically listed in § 27.1164(b), as well as any reimbursable items not specifically listed in § 27.1164(b) that are directly attributable to actual relocation costs. Specifically, the AWS relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must submit, in the first instance, only the uniform cost data requested by the clearinghouse along with a copy, without redaction, of either the relocation agreement, if any, or the third party appraisal described in (b)(1), if relocation was undertaken by the microwave incumbent. AWS relocators, MSS/ATC relocators and voluntarily relocating microwave incumbents must maintain documentation of cost-related issues until the applicable sunset date and provide such documentation upon request, to the clearinghouse, the Commission, or entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation. If an AWS relocator pays a microwave incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities, the AWS relocator must estimate the costs associated with relocating the incumbent by itemizing the anticipated cost for items listed in § 27.1164(b).

The voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must also submit an independent third party appraisal of its compensable relocation costs. The appraisal should be based on the actual cost of replacing the incumbent's system with comparable facilities and should exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades or items outside the scope of § 27.1164(b).</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Identification of links</E>. The AWS relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent, must identify the particular link associated with appropriate expenses (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, costs may not be averaged over numerous links). Where the AWS relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent relocates both paths of a paired channel microwave link (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, 2110-2130 MHz with 2160-2180 MHz and 2130-2150 MHz with 2180-2200 MHz), the AWS relocator, MSS/ATC relocator, or voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent must identify the expenses associated with each paired microwave link.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Full Reimbursement</E>. An AWS relocator who relocates a microwave link that is either fully outside its market area or its licensed frequency band may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of compensable costs, up to the reimbursement cap as defined in § 27.1164(b). Such reimbursement will not be subject to depreciation under the cost-sharing formula.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Good Faith Requirement</E>. New entrants and incumbent licensees are expected to act in good faith in satisfying the cost-sharing obligations under §§ 27.1160 through 27.1174. The requirement to act in good faith extends to, but is not limited to, the preparation and submission of the documentation <PRTPAGE P="364"/>required in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

MSS operators are not required to submit reimbursements to the clearinghouse for links relocated due to interference from MSS space-to-Earth downlink operations, but may elect to do so, in which case the MSS operator must identify the reimbursement claim as such and follow the applicable procedures governing reimbursement in part 27. MSS reimbursement rights and cost-sharing obligations for space-to-Earth downlink operations are governed by § 101.82 of this chapter.</P>

Where a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent relocates a paired microwave link with paths in the 2130-2150 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz bands, it may not seek reimbursement from MSS operators (including MSS/ATC operators), but is entitled to partial reimbursement from the first AWS beneficiary, equal to fifty percent of its actual costs for relocating the paired link, or half of the reimbursement cap in § 27.1164(b), whichever is less. This amount is subject to depreciation as specified § 27.1164(b). An AWS licensee who is obligated to reimburse relocation costs under this rule is entitled to obtain reimbursement from other AWS beneficiaries in accordance with §§ 27.1164 and 27.1168. For purposes of applying the cost-sharing formula relative to other AWS licensees that benefit from the self-relocation, the fifty percent attributable to the AWS entrant shall be treated as the entire cost of the link relocation, and depreciation shall run from the date on which the clearinghouse issues the notice of an obligation to reimburse the voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent. The cost-sharing obligations for MSS operators in the 2180-2200 MHz band are governed by § 101.82 of this chapter.</P>

                        <P>(a) The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine when an AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity has triggered a cost-sharing obligation and therefore must pay an AWS relocator, MSS relocator (including MSS/ATC), or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent in accordance with the formula detailed in § 27.1164:</P>
                        <P>(1) All or part of the relocated microwave link was initially co-channel with the licensed AWS band(s) of the AWS entity or the selected assignment of the MSS operator that seeks and obtains ATC authority (see § 25.149(a)(2)(i) of this chapter);</P>
                        <P>(2) An AWS relocator, MSS relocator (including MSS/ATC) or a voluntarily relocating microwave incumbent has paid the relocation costs of the microwave incumbent; and</P>
                        <P>(3) The AWS or MSS entity is operating or preparing to turn on a fixed base station (including MSS/ATC) at commercial power and the fixed base station is located within a rectangle (Proximity Threshold) described as follows:</P>
                        <P>(i) The length of the rectangle shall be <E T="03">x</E> where <E T="03">x</E> is a line extending through both nodes of the microwave link to a distance of 48 kilometers (30 miles) beyond each node. The width of the rectangle shall be <E T="03">y</E> where <E T="03">y</E> is a line perpendicular to <E T="03">x</E> and extending for a distance of 24 kilometers (15 miles) on both sides of <E T="03">x</E>. Thus, the rectangle is represented as follows:

                        <P>Prior to initiating operations for a newly constructed site or modified existing site, an AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity is required to file a notice containing site-specific data with the clearinghouse. The notice regarding the new or modified site must provide a detailed description of the proposed site's spectral frequency use and geographic location, including but not limited to the applicant's name and address, the name of the transmitting base station, the geographic coordinates corresponding to that base station, the frequencies and polarizations to be added, changed or deleted, and the emission designator. If a prior coordination notice (PCN) under § 101.103(d) of this chapter is prepared, AWS entities can satisfy the site-data filing requirement by submitting a copy of their PCN to the clearinghouse. AWS entities or MSS/ATC entities that file either a notice or a PCN have a continuing duty to maintain the accuracy of the site-specific data on file with the clearinghouse. Utilizing the site-specific data, the clearinghouse will determine if any reimbursement obligation exists and notify the AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity in writing of its repayment obligation, if any. When the AWS entity or MSS/ATC entity receives a written copy of such obligation, it must pay directly to the relocator the amount owed within 30 calendar days.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Cost-sharing requirements for AWS in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) Frequencies in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band have been reallocated from the Broadband Radio Service (BRS) to AWS. All AWS entities who benefit from another AWS entity's clearance of BRS incumbents from this spectrum, including BRS incumbents occupying the 2150-2162 MHz band on a primary basis, must contribute to such relocation costs. Only AWS entrants that relocate BRS incumbents are entitled to such reimbursement.</P>
                        <P>(b) AWS entities may satisfy their reimbursement requirement by entering into private cost-sharing agreements or agreeing to terms other than those specified in § 27.1180. However, AWS entities are required to reimburse other AWS entities that incur relocation costs and are not parties to the alternative agreement. In addition, parties to a private cost-sharing agreement may seek reimbursement through the clearinghouse (as discussed in § 27.1178) from AWS entities that are not parties to the agreement. The cost-sharing plan is in effect during all phases of BRS relocation until the end of the period specified in § 27.1190. If an AWS licensee enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement and the spectrum lessee triggers a cost-sharing obligation, the licensee is the AWS entity responsible for satisfying cost-sharing obligations under these rules.</P>

This clearinghouse(s) will administer the cost-sharing plan by, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> determining the cost-sharing obligations of AWS entities for the relocation of BRS incumbents from the 2150-2162 MHz band. The clearinghouse filing requirements (<E T="03">see</E> §§ 27.1182(a), 27.1186) will not take effect until an administrator is selected.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>The cost-sharing formula.</SUBJECT>

                        <P>(a) An AWS licensee that relocates a BRS system with which it interferes is entitled to <E T="03">pro rata</E> reimbursement based on the cost-sharing formula specified in § 27.1164, except that the depreciation factor shall be [180−T<E T="52">m</E>]/180, and the variable <E T="03">C</E> shall be applied as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">C</E> is the actual cost of relocating the system, and includes, but is not limited to, such items as: Radio terminal equipment (TX and/or RX—antenna, necessary feed lines, MUX/Modems); towers and/or modifications; back-up power equipment; monitoring or control equipment; engineering costs (design/path survey); installation; systems testing; FCC filing costs; site acquisition and civil works; zoning costs; training; disposal of old equipment; test equipment (vendor required); spare equipment; project management; site lease renegotiation; required antenna upgrades for interference control; power plant upgrade (if <PRTPAGE P="367"/>required); electrical grounding systems; Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) (if required); alternate transport equipment; leased facilities; and end user units served by the base station that is being relocated. In addition to actual costs, <E T="03">C</E> may include the cost of an independent third party appraisal conducted pursuant to § 27.1182(a)(3) and incumbent transaction expenses that are directly attributable to the relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the “hard” costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and engineering expenses. There is no cap on the actual costs of relocation.</P>
                        <P>(c) An AWS system shall be considered an interfering system for purposes of this rule if the AWS system is in all or part of the BRS frequency band and operates within line of sight to BRS operations under the applicable test specified in § 27.1184. An AWS relocator that relocates a BRS system with which it does not interfere is entitled to full reimbursement, as specified in § 27.1182(c).</P>

                        <P>(a) <E T="03">Registration of reimbursement rights.</E> (1) To obtain reimbursement, an AWS relocator must submit documentation of the relocation agreement to the clearinghouse within 30 calendar days of the date a relocation agreement is signed with an incumbent. In the case of involuntary relocation, an AWS relocator must submit documentation of the relocated system within 30 calendar days after the end of the one-year trial period.</P>
                        <P>(2) Registration of any BRS system shall include:</P>
                        <P>(i) A description of the system's frequency use;</P>
                        <P>(ii) If the system exclusively provides one-way transmissions to subscribers, the Geographic Service Area of the system; and</P>
                        <P>(iii) If the system does not exclusively provide one-way transmission to subscribers, the system hub antenna's geographic location and the above ground level height of the system's receiving antenna centerline.</P>
                        <P>(3) The AWS relocator must also include with its system registration an independent third party appraisal of the compensable relocation costs. The appraisal should be based on the actual cost of replacing the incumbent's system with comparable facilities and should exclude the cost of any equipment upgrades that are not necessary to the provision of comparable facilities. An AWS relocator may submit registration without a third party appraisal if it consents to binding resolution by the clearinghouse of any good faith cost disputes regarding the reimbursement claim, under the following standard: The relocator shall bear the burden of proof, and be required to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that its request does not exceed the actual cost of relocating the relevant BRS system or systems to comparable facilities. Failure to satisfy this burden of proof will result in loss of rights to subsequent reimbursement of the disputed costs from any AWS licensee.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation of expenses.</E> Once relocation occurs, the AWS relocator must submit documentation itemizing the amount spent for items specifically listed in § 27.1180(b), as well as any reimbursable items not specifically listed in § 27.1180(b) that are directly attributable to actual relocation costs. Specifically, the AWS relocator must submit, in the first instance, only the uniform cost data requested by the clearinghouse along with copies, without redaction, of the relocation agreement, if any, and the third party appraisal described in (a)(3), of this section, if prepared. The AWS relocator must identify the particular system associated with appropriate expenses (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, costs may not be averaged over numerous systems). If an AWS relocator pays a BRS incumbent a monetary sum to relocate its own facilities in whole or in part, the AWS relocator must itemize the actual costs to the extent determinable, and otherwise must estimate the actual costs associated with relocating the incumbent and itemize these costs. If the sum paid to the incumbent cannot be accounted for, the remaining <PRTPAGE P="368"/>amount is not eligible for reimbursement. All AWS relocators seeking reimbursement through the clearinghouse have an ongoing duty to maintain all relevant records of BRS relocation-related expenses until the sunset of cost-sharing obligations, and to provide, upon request, such documentation, including a copy of the independent appraisal if one was conducted, to the clearinghouse, the Commission, or AWS entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Full reimbursement.</E> An AWS relocator who relocates a BRS system that is either:</P>
                        <P>(1) Wholly outside its frequency band; or</P>
                        <P>(2) Not within line of sight of the relocator's transmitting base station may seek full reimbursement through the clearinghouse of compensable costs. Such reimbursement will not be subject to depreciation under the cost-sharing formula.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Good Faith Requirement.</E> New entrants and incumbent licensees are expected to act in good faith in satisfying the cost-sharing obligations under §§ 27.1176 through 27.1190. The requirement to act in good faith extends to, but is not limited to, the preparation and submission of the documentation required in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

                        <P>(a) The clearinghouse will apply the following test to determine when an AWS entity has triggered a cost-sharing obligation and therefore must pay an AWS relocator of a BRS system in accordance with the formula detailed in § 27.1180:</P>
                        <P>(1) All or part of the relocated BRS system was initially co-channel with the licensed AWS band(s) of the AWS entity;</P>
                        <P>(2) An AWS relocator has paid the relocation costs of the BRS incumbent; and</P>
                        <P>(3) The other AWS entity has turned on or is preparing to turn on a fixed base station at commercial power and the incumbent BRS system would have been within the line of sight of the AWS entity's fixed base station, defined as follows.</P>
                        <P>(i) For a BRS system using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band exclusively to provide one-way transmissions to subscribers, the clearinghouse will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's geographic service area (GSA), based on the following criteria: use of 9.1 meters (30 feet) for the receiving antenna height, use of the actual transmitting antenna height and terrain elevation, and assumption of 4/3 Earth radius propagation conditions. Terrain elevation data must be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 3-second database. All coordinates used in carrying out the required analysis shall be based upon use of NAD-83.</P>

                        <P>(ii) For all other BRS systems using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the clearinghouse will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's receive station hub using the method prescribed in “Methods for Predicting Interference from Response Station Transmitters and to Response Station Hubs and for Supplying Data on Response Station Systems.

                        <P>(b) If the application of the trigger test described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, indicates that a reimbursement obligation exists, the clearinghouse will calculate the reimbursement amount in accordance with the cost-sharing formula and notify the subsequent AWS entity of the total amount of its reimbursement obligation.</P>
                        <P>(c) Once a reimbursement obligation is triggered, the AWS entity may not avoid paying its cost-sharing obligation by deconstructing or modifying its facilities.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>EBS eligibility.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) A license for an Educational Broadband Service station will be issued only to an accredited institution or to a governmental organization engaged in the formal education of enrolled students or to a nonprofit organization whose purposes are educational and include providing educational and instructional television material to such accredited institutions and governmental organizations, and which is otherwise qualified under the statutory provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</P>
                      <P>(1) A publicly supported educational institution must be accredited by the appropriate State department of education.</P>
                      <P>(2) A privately controlled educational institution must be accredited by the appropriate State department of education or the recognized regional and national accrediting organizations.</P>

                      <P>(3) Those applicant organizations whose eligibility is established by service to accredited institutional or governmental organizations must submit documentation from proposed receive sites demonstrating that they will receive and use the applicant's educational usage. In place of this documentation, a State educational television (ETV) commission may demonstrate that the public schools it proposes to serve are required to use its proposed educational usage. Documentation from proposed receive sites which are to establish the eligibility of <PRTPAGE P="370"/>an entity not serving its own enrolled students for credit should be in letter form, written and signed by an administrator or authority who is responsible for the receive site's curriculum planning. No receive site more than 35 miles from the proposed station's central reference point, or outside the applicants' proposed GSA, shall be used to establish basic eligibility. Where broadband or data services are proposed, the letter should indicate that the data services will be used in furtherance of the institution's educational mission and will be provided to enrolled students, faculty and staff in a manner and in a setting conducive to educational usage. Where traditional educational or instructional video services are proposed, the letter should indicate that the applicant's program offerings have been viewed and that such programming will be incorporated in the site's curriculum. Where educational or instructional video services are proposed, the letter should discuss the types of programming and hours per week of formal and informal programming expected to be used and the site's involvement in the planning, scheduling and production of programming. If other levels of authority must be obtained before a firm commitment to utilize the service can be made, the nature and extent of such additional authorization(s) must be provided.</P>
                      <P>(4) Nonlocal applicants, in addition to submitting letters from proposed receive sites, must demonstrate the establishment of a local program committee in each community where they apply. Letters submitted on behalf of a nonlocal entity must confirm that a member of the receive site's staff will serve on the local program committee and demonstrate a recognition of the composition and power of the committee. The letter should show that the staff member will aid in the selection, scheduling and production of the programming received over the system.</P>
                      <P>(b) No numerical limit is placed on the number of stations which may be licensed to a single licensee. A single license may be issued for more than one transmitter if they are to be located at a common site and operated by the same licensee. Applicants are expected to accomplish the proposed operation by the use of the smallest number of channels required to provide the needed service.</P>
                      <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
                      <P>(d) This paragraph applies to EBS licensees and applications licensed or filed pursuant to the provisions of § 27.1201(c) contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 20 through 39, revised as of October 1, 2005, or §§ 74.990 through 74.992 contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 70 through 79, revised as of October 1, 2004, and that do not meet the eligibility requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Such licensees may continue to operate pursuant to the terms of their existing licenses, and their licenses may be renewed, assigned, or transferred, so long as the licensee is otherwise in compliance with this chapter. Applications filed pursuant to the provisions of § 27.1201(c) contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 20 through 39, revised as of October 1, 2005 or §§ 74.990 through 74.992 contained in the edition of 47 CFR parts 70 through 79, revised as of October 1, 2004 may be processed and granted, so long as such applications were filed prior to July 19, 2006. The provisions of §§ 27.1203(b) through (d) and 27.1214 of this subpart do not apply to licenses governed by this paragraph.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Cable/BRS cross-ownership.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Initial or modified authorizations for BRS stations may not be granted to a cable operator if a portion of the BRS station's protected services area is within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable operator's cable system and the cable operator will be using the BRS station as a multichannel video programming distributor (as defined in § 76.64(d) of this chapter). No cable operator may acquire such authorization either directly, or indirectly through an affiliate owned, operated, or controlled by or under common control with a cable operator if the cable operator will use the BRS station as a multichannel video programming distributor.</P>

                      <P>(b) No licensee of a station in this service may lease transmission time or <PRTPAGE P="371"/>capacity to a cable operator either directly, or indirectly through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled by, or under common control with a cable operator, if a portion of the BRS station's protected services area is within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable operator's cable system the cable operator will use the BRS station as a multichannel video programming distributor.</P>
                      <P>(c) Applications for new stations, station modifications, assignments or transfers of control by cable operators of BRS stations shall include a showing that no portion of the GSA of the BRS station is within the portion of the franchise area actually served by the cable operator's cable system, or of any entity indirectly affiliated, owned, operated, controlled by, or under common control with the cable operator. Alternatively, the cable operator may certify that it will not use the BRS station to distribute multichannel video programming.</P>
                      <P>(d) In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and other interests in BRS licensees or cable television systems will be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable pursuant to the following criteria:</P>
                      <P>(1) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct ownership interests and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate BRS licensee or cable television system will be cognizable;</P>
                      <P>(2) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if they hold 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate BRS licensee or cable television system, or if any of the officers or directors of the BRS licensee or cable television system are representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if under common management.</P>
                      <P>(3) Attribution of ownership interests in a BRS licensee or cable television system that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be included for purposes of this multiplication. For purposes of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, attribution of ownership interests in a BRS licensee or cable television system that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening organizations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, and the ownership percentage for any link in the chain that exceeds 50% shall be included for purposes of this multiplication. For example, except for purposes of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns 25% of “Licensee,” then X's interest in “Licensee” would be 25% (the same as Y's interest because X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in “Licensee” would be 2.5% (0.1 × 0.25). Under the 5% attribution benchmark, X's interest in “Licensee” would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable. For purposes of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, X's interest in “Licensee” would be 15% (0.6 × 0.25) and A's interest in “Licensee” would be 1.5% (0.1 × 0.6 × 0.25). Neither interest would be attributed under paragraph (d)(9) of this section.</P>

                      <P>(4) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the <PRTPAGE P="372"/>stock interests held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's assets unless all voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the relevant BRS licensee or cable television system are subject to said trust.</P>
                      <P>(5) Subject to paragraph (d)(9) of this section, holders of non-voting stock shall not be attributed an interest in the issuing entity. Subject to paragraph (d)(9) of this section, holders of debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, options or other non-voting interests with rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until conversion is effected.</P>
                      <P>(6)(i) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable television activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so certifies. An interest in a Limited Liability Company (“LLC”) or Registered Limited Liability Partnership (“RLLP”) shall be attributed to the interest holder unless that interest holder is not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable television activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so certifies.</P>
                      <P>(ii) For a licensee or system that is a limited partnership to make the certification set forth in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, it must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable television activities of the partnership. For a licensee or system that is an LLC or RLLP to make the certification set forth in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, it must verify that the organizational document, with respect to the particular interest holder exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt interest holder has no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable television activities of the LLC or RLLP. Irrespective of the terms of the certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement, or other organizational document in the case of an LLC or RLLP, however, no such certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the limited partners, or other interest holders in the case of an LLC or RLLP, in the management or operation of the BRS or cable television businesses of the partnership or LLC or RLLP.</P>
                      <P>(iii) In the case of an LLC or RLLP, the licensee or system seeking installation shall certify, in addition, that the relevant state statute authorizing LLCs permits an LLC member to insulate itself as required by our criteria.</P>
                      <P>(7) Officers and directors of a BRS licensee or cable television system are considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses in addition to its primary business of BRS or cable television service, it may request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its primary business. The officers and directors of a parent company of a BRS licensee or cable television system, with an attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly unrelated to the BRS licensee or cable television system subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting this fact is submitted to the Commission. The officers and directors of a sister corporation of a BRS licensee or cable television system shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by virtue of such status.</P>
                      <P>(8) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if:</P>

                      <P>(i) The sum of the interests held by or through “passive investors” is equal to or exceeds 20 percent; or<PRTPAGE P="373"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(ii) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through “passive investors” is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or</P>
                      <P>(iii) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section equal to or exceeds 20 percent.</P>
                      <P>(9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section, the holder of an equity or debt interest or interests in a BRS licensee or cable television system subject to the BRS/cable cross-ownership rule (“interest holder”) shall have that interest attributed if:</P>
                      <P>(i) The equity (including all stockholdings, whether voting or nonvoting, common or preferred) and debt interest or interests, in the aggregate, exceed 33 percent of the total asset value (all equity plus all debt) of that BRS licensee or cable television system; and</P>
                      <P>(ii) The interest holder also holds an interest in a BRS licensee or cable television system that is attributable under this section (other than this paragraph) and which operates in any portion of the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable system.</P>
                      <P>(10) The term “area served by a cable system” means any area actually passed by the cable operator's cable system and which can be connected for a standard connection fee.</P>
                      <P>(11) As used in this section “cable operator” shall have the same definition as in § 76.5 of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(e) The Commission will entertain requests to waive the restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section where necessary to ensure that all significant portions of the franchise area are able to obtain multichannel video service.</P>
                      <P>(f) The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will not apply to one BRS channel used to provide locally-produced programming to cable headends. Locally-produced programming is programming produced in or near the cable operator's franchise area and not broadcast on a television station available within that franchise area. A cable operator will be permitted one BRS channel for this purpose, and no more than one BRS channel may be used by a cable television company or its affiliate or lessor pursuant to this paragraph. The licensee for a cable operator providing local programming pursuant to a lease must include in a notice filed with the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau a cover letter explicitly identifying itself or its lessees as a local cable operator and stating that the lease was executed to facilitate the provision of local programming. The first application or the first lease notification in an area filed with the Commission will be entitled to the exemption. The limitations on one BRS channel per party and per area include any cable/BRS operations or cable/EBS operations. The cable operator must demonstrate in its BRS application that the proposed local programming will be provided within one year from the date its application is granted. Local programming service pursuant to a lease must be provided within one year of the date of the lease or one year of grant of the licensee's application for the leased channel, whichever is later. If a BRS license for these purposes is granted and the programming is subsequently discontinued, the license will be automatically forfeited the day after local programming service is discontinued.</P>
                      <P>(g) Applications filed by cable television companies, or affiliates, for BRS channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the prohibitions of this section. Applications filed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and BRS entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this section. Leases between cable television companies, or affiliates, and BRS station licensees, conditional licensees, or applicants executed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter, are invalid.</P>

                      <P>(1) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates, for BRS channels prior to February 8, 1990, will not be subject to the prohibitions of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)of this section, applications filed on February 8, 1990, or thereafter will be returned. Lease arrangements between cable and BRS entities for which a lease or a firm agreement was signed prior to February 8, 1990, will also not be subject to the prohibitions of this <PRTPAGE P="374"/>section. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, leases between cable operators, or affiliates, and BRS/EBS station licensees, conditional licensees, or applicants executed on or before February 8, 1990, or thereafter are invalid.</P>
                      <P>(2) Applications filed by cable operators, or affiliates for BRS channels after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not be subject to the prohibition of this section, if, pursuant to the then existing overbuild or rural exceptions, the applications were allowed under the then existing cable/BRS cross-ownership prohibitions. Lease arrangements between cable operators and BRS entities for which a lease or firm agreement was signed after February 8, 1990, and prior to October 5, 1992, will not be subject to the prohibitions of this section, if, pursuant to the then existing rural and overbuild exceptions, the lease arrangements were allowed.</P>
                      <P>(3) The limitations on cable television ownership in this section do not apply to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 623(l) of the Communications Act.</P>

                      <P>Except for incumbent BRS licenses, BRS service areas are Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) or additional service areas similar to BTAs adopted by the Commission. BTAs are based on the Rand McNally 1992 Commercial Atlas &amp; Marketing Guide, 123rd Edition, at pages 38-39. The following are additional BRS service areas in places where Rand McNally has not defined BTAs: American Samoa; Guam; Gulf of Mexico Zone A; Gulf of Mexico Zone B; Gulf of Mexico Zone C; Northern Mariana Islands; Mayaguez/Aguadilla-Ponce, Puerto Rico; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and the United States Virgin Islands. The boundaries of Gulf of Mexico Zone A are from an area twelve nautical miles from the shoreline at mean high tide on the north and east, to the limit of the Outer Continental Shelf to the south, and to longitude 91°00′ to the west. The boundaries of Gulf of Mexico Zone B are from an area twelve nautical miles from the shoreline at mean high tide on the north, to the limit of the Outer Continental Shelf to the south, to longitude 91°00′ to the east, and to longitude 94°00′ to the west. The boundaries of Gulf of Mexico Zone C are from an area twelve nautical miles from the shoreline at mean high tide on the north and west, to longitude 94°00′ to the east, and to a line 281 kilometers from the reference point at Linares, N.L., Mexico on the southwest. The Mayaguez/Aguadilla-Ponce, PR, service area consists of the following municipios: Adjuntas, Aguada, Aguadilla, Anasco, Arroyo, Cabo Rojo, Coamo, Guanica, Guayama, Guayanilla, Hormigueros, Isabela, Jayuya, Juana Diaz, Lajas, Las Marias, Maricao, Maunabo, Mayaguez, Moca, Patillas, Penuelas, Ponce, Quebradillas, Rincón, Sabana Grande, Salinas, San German, Santa Isabel, Villalba and Yauco. The San Juan service area consists of all other municipios in Puerto Rico.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>EBS spectrum leasing arrangements and grandfathered leases.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) A licensee in the EBS that is solely utilizing analog transmissions may enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement to transmit material other than the educational programming defined in § 27.1203(b) and (c) subject to the following conditions:</P>

                      <P>(1) Before entering into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving material other than educational programming on any one channel, the licensee must provide at least 20 hours per week of EBS educational programming (as defined in § 27.1203(b) and (c)) on that channel, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. An additional 20 hours per week per channel must be strictly reserved for EBS use and not used for non-EBS purposes, or reserved for recapture by the EBS licensee for its EBS educational usage, subject to one year's advance, written notification by the EBS licensee to its lessee and accounting for all recapture already exercised, with no economic or operational detriment to the licensee. These hours of recapture are not restricted as to time of day or day of the week, but may be established by negotiations between the EBS licensee and the lessee. The 20 hours per channel per week EBS educational usage requirement and the recapture and/or reservation requirement of an additional 20 hours per channel <PRTPAGE P="378"/>per week shall apply spectrally over the licensee's whole actual service area.</P>
                      <P>(2) For the first two years of operation, an EBS entity may enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving material other than educational programming if it provides EBS educational usage for at least 12 hours per channel per week, provided that the entity does not employ channel loading technology.</P>
                      <P>(3) The licensee may shift its requisite EBS educational usage onto fewer than its authorized number of channels, via channel mapping or channel loading technology, so that it can enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving full-time channel capacity on its EBS station and/or associated EBS booster stations, subject to the condition that it provide a total average of at least 20 hours per channel per week of EBS educational usage on its authorized channels. The use of channel mapping or channel loading consistent with the Rules shall not be considered adversely to the EBS licensee in seeking a license renewal. The licensee also retains the unabridgeable right to recapture, subject to six months' advance written notification by the EBS licensee to the spectrum lessee, an average of an additional 20 hours per channel per week, accounting for all recapture already exercised. Regardless of whether the licensee has educational receive sites within its GSA, the licensee may lease booster stations in the entire GSA, provided that the licensee maintains the unabridgeable right to ready recapture at least 40 hours per channel per week for EBS educational usage. The licensee may agree to the transmission of this recapture time on channels not authorized to it, but which are included in the wireless system of which it is a part. A licensee under this paragraph which enters into a spectrum leasing arrangement on any one of its channels to an operator may “channel shift” pursuant to and under the conditions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(b) A licensee utilizing digital transmissions on any of its licensed channels may enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement to transmit material other than the educational programming defined in § 27.1203(b) and (c), subject to the following conditions:</P>
                      <P>(1) The licensee must reserve a minimum of 5% of the capacity of its channels for educational uses consistent with § 27.1203 paragraphs (b) and (c), and may not enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving this reserved capacity. In addition, before leasing excess capacity, the licensee must provide at least 20 hours per licensed channel per week of EBS educational usage. This 5% reservation and this 20 hours per licensed channel per week EBS educational usage requirement shall apply spectrally over the licensee's whole actual service area. However, regardless of whether the licensee has an educational receive site within its GSA served by a booster, the licensee may lease excess capacity without making at least 20 hours per licensed channel per week of EBS educational usage, provided that the licensee maintains the unabridgeable right to recapture on one months' advance notice such capacity as it requires over and above the 5% reservation to make at least 20 hours per channel per week of EBS educational usage.</P>

                      <P>(2) The licensee may shift its requisite EBS educational usage onto fewer than its authorized number of channels, via channel mapping or channel loading technology, and may shift its requisite EBS educational usage onto channels not authorized to it, but which are included in the wireless system of which it is a part (“channel shifting”), so that it can enter into a spectrum leasing arrangement involving full-time channel capacity on its EBS station, associated EBS booster stations, and/or EBS response stations and associated response station hubs, subject to the condition that it provide a total average of at least 20 hours per licensed channel per week of EBS educational usage. The use of channel mapping, channel loading, and/or channel shifting consistent with the Rules shall not be considered adversely to the EBS licensee in seeking a license renewal. In addition, an EBS entity receiving interference protection will continue to receive such protection if it elects to swap channels with another EBS or BRS station.<PRTPAGE P="379"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(c) All spectrum leasing arrangements involving EBS spectrum must afford the EBS licensee an opportunity to purchase or to lease the dedicated or common EBS equipment used for educational purposes, or comparable equipment in the event that the spectrum leasing arrangement is terminated.</P>
                      <P>(d) All leases of current EBS spectrum entered into prior to January 10, 2005 and in compliance with leasing rules formerly contained in part 74 of this chapter may continue in force and effect, notwithstanding any inconsistency between such leases and the rules applicable to spectrum leasing arrangements set forth in this chapter. Such leases entered into pursuant to the former part 74 rules of this chapter may be renewed and assigned in accordance with the terms of such lease. All spectrum leasing arrangements leases entered into after January 10, 2005, pursuant to the rules set forth in part 1 and part 27 of this chapter, must comply with the rules in those parts.</P>

In furtherance of the educational purposes for which EBS spectrum is primarily allocated, any spectrum leasing arrangement in excess of 15 years that is entered into on or after July 19, 2006 must include terms which provide the EBS licensee on the 15th year and every 5 years thereafter, with an opportunity to review its educational use requirements in light of changes in educational needs, technology, and other relevant factors and to obtain access to such additional services, capacity, support, and/or equipment as the parties shall agree upon in the spectrum leasing arrangement to advance the EBS licensee's educational mission.</P>

The GSA is the area bounded by a circle having a 35 mile radius and centered at the station's reference coordinates, and is bounded by the chord(s) drawn between intersection points of that circle and those of respective adjacent market, co-channel licensees.</P>
                      <P>(b) If there is more than 50 percent overlap between the calculated GSA of a grandfathered EBS license and the protected service area of a co-channel BRS license, the licensees shall not be immediately granted a geographic service area. Instead, the grandfathered EBS license and the co-channel BRS licensee must negotiate in good faith to reach a solution that accommodates the communication needs of both licensees. If the co-channel licensees reach a mutually agreeable solution on or before October 17, 2006, then the GSA of each co-channel license shall be as determined pursuant to the agreement of the parties. If a mutually agreeable solution between co-channel licensees is not reached on or before October 17, 2006, then each co-channel licensee shall receive a GSA determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and § 27.1206(a).</P>

                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Height benchmarking.</E> Height benchmarking is defined for pairs of base stations, one in each of two proximate geographic service areas (GSAs). The height benchmark, which is defined in meters (hb<E T="8052">m</E>) for a particular base station relative to a base station in another GSA, is equal to the distance, in kilometers, from the base station along a radial to the nearest point on the GSA boundary of the other base station squared (D<E T="8052">km</E>

                          <SU>2</SU>) and then divided by 17. That is, hb (<E T="8052">m</E>) = D<E T="8052">km</E>

                          <SU>2</SU>/17. A base station antenna will be considered to be within its applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the height in meters of its centerline of radiation above average elevation (HAAE) calculated along the straight line between the two base stations in accordance with §§ 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter does not exceed the height benchmark (hb<E T="8052">m</E>). A base station antenna will be considered to exceed its applicable height benchmark relative to another base station if the HAAE of its centerline of radiation calculated along the straight line between the two <PRTPAGE P="381"/>base stations in accordance with §§ 24.53(b) and (c) of this chapter exceeds the height benchmark (hb<E T="52">m</E>).</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Protection for receiving antennas not exceeding the height benchmark.</E> Absent agreement between the two licensees to the contrary, if a transmitting antenna of one BRS/EBS licensee's base station exceeds its applicable height benchmark and such licensee is notified by another BRS/EBS licensee that it is generating an undesired signal level in excess of −107 dBm/5.5 megahertz at the receiver of a co-channel base station that is within its applicable height benchmark, then the licensee of the base station that exceeds its applicable height benchmark shall either limit the undesired signal at the receiver of the protected base station to −107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less or reduce the height of its transmission antenna to no more than the height benchmark. If the interfering base station has been modified to increase the EIRP transmitted in the direction of the protected base station, it shall be deemed to have commenced operations on the date of such modification. Such corrective action shall be completed no later than:</P>
                        <P>(i) 24 hours after receiving such notification, if the base station that exceeds its height benchmark commenced operations after the station that is within its applicable height benchmark; or</P>
                        <P>(ii) 90 days after receiving such notification, if the base station that exceeds its height commenced operations prior to the station that is within its applicable height benchmark. For purposes of this section, if the interfering base station has been modified to increase the EIRP transmitted in the direction of the victim base station, it shall be deemed to have commenced operations on the date of such modification.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">No protection from a transmitting antenna not exceeding the height benchmark.</E> The licensee of a base station transmitting antenna less than or equal to its applicable height benchmark shall not be required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to limit that antennas undesired signal level to −107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less at the receiver of any co-channel base station.</P>
                        <P>(e) <E T="03">No protection for a receiving-antenna exceeding the height benchmark.</E> The licensee of a base station receive antenna that exceeds its applicable height benchmark shall not be entitled pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section to insist that any co-channel base station limit its undesired signal level to −107dBm/5.5 megahertz or less at the receiver.</P>
                        <P>(f) <E T="03">Information exchange.</E> A BRS/EBS licensee shall provide the geographic coordinates, the height above ground level of the center of radiation for each transmit and receive antenna, and the date transmissions commenced for each of the base stations in its GSA within 30 days of receipt of a request from a co-channel BRS/EBS licensee with an operational base station located in a proximate GSA. Information shared pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed to other parties except as required to ensure compliance with this section.</P>

                        <P>BRS and EBS licensees in the 2500-2690 MHz band on the pre-transition A-I Channels will be transitioned from the frequencies assigned to them under § 27.5(i)(1) to the frequencies assigned to <PRTPAGE P="382"/>them under § 27.5(i)(2). The transition, which will be undertaken by one or more proponent(s), will occur in the following five phases: initiating the transition process (see § 27.1231), planning the transition (see § 27.1232), reimbursing transition costs (see §§ 27.1233 and 27.1237-1239), terminating existing operations in transitioned markets that do not comport with § 27.5(i)(2) (see § 27.1234), and filing the post-transition notification (see § 27.1235). Licensees may also self-transition (see § 27.1236).</P>

                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Safe harbors.</E> An offer by a proponent(s) shall be reasonable if it meets one of the following safe harbors:</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Safe harbor No. 1.</E> This safe harbor applies when the default high-power channel assigned to each channel group <PRTPAGE P="385"/>is authorized to operate after the transition with the same transmission parameters (coordinates, antenna pattern, height of center radiation, EIRP) as the downstream facilities before the transition. If the proponent(s) does not propose a change in the geographic coordinates of the facilities (other than as necessary to conform the actual location with the Commission's Antenna Survey Branch database), the proponent may also propose the following to the extent consistent with this subpart:</P>
                        <P>(i) An increase in the height of the center of radiation of the transmission antenna or a decrease in such height of no more than 8 meters (provided that such change does not result in an increase in antenna support structure lease costs to the EBS licensee and the consent of the owner of the antenna support structure is obtained).</P>
                        <P>(ii) A change in the EIRP of the transmission system of up to 1.5 dB in any direction.</P>
                        <P>(iii) Digitization, precision frequency offset, or other upgrades to the EBS transmission or reception systems that allow the proponent(s) to invoke more advantageous interference protection requirements applicable to upgraded systems.</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Safe harbor No. 2.</E> This safe harbor applies when an EBS licensee has channel-shifted its single video programming or data transmission track to spectrum licensed to another licensee. Under § 27.5(i)(2), that track must be on the high-power channel licensed to the EBS licensee upon completion of the transition. For example, before the transition, an A Group licensee might have shifted its EBS video programming to channel C1. If one of the pre-transition A Group channels is licensed with technical parameters substantially similar to those of pre-transition channel C1, the Transition Plan may provide for high-power channel A4 to be licensed with the same technical parameters as the pre-transition channel C1. However, if the pre-transition A Group channels are licensed to operate with technical parameters materially different from those of pre-transition channel C1, the proponent(s) may:</P>
                        <P>(i) Arrange a channel swap with the licensee of the C Group so that the A Group licensee will receive high-power channel C4 (which will automatically be licensed with the same transmission parameters as the pre-transition channel C1) in exchange for channel A4.</P>

                        <P>(ii) Arrange for high-power channel A4 to operate with transmission parameters substantially similar to those of the pre-transition channel C1 (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (d)(1) of this section).</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Safe harbor No. 3.</E> This safe harbor applies when a four-channel group is shared among multiple licensees in a given geographic area. Absent an agreement otherwise, a proponent may:</P>
                        <P>(i) Secure a 6 MHz MBS channel for each licensee in exchange for the non-MBS channels assigned to the group. Following the channel swap(s) necessary to secure those additional MBS channels, the Transition Plan can provide for the licensing of the remaining channels in the LBS, UBS, and Guard Bands on a pro rata basis (with channel(s) in each segment being disaggregated when and if necessary to provide each with its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment);</P>
                        <P>(ii) Provide for pro rata segmentation of the default MBS channel for the group, provided that the proponent commits to provide each of the licensees with the technology necessary for its EBS video programming or data transmissions to be digitized, transmitted and received utilizing the provided bandwidth. The non-MBS channels would be divided among the sharing licensees on a pro rata basis (with channel(s) in each segment being disaggregated when and if necessary to provide each with its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment); or</P>

                        <P>(iii) Assign the default MBS channel assigned to the channel group to one of the licensees, if that licensee is the only one that elects to migrate video programming or data transmission tracks to the MBS. The remaining spectrum assigned to the group may be allocated among the licensees on a pro rata basis, with the 6 MHz in the MBS counting against that licensee's portion. To the extent necessary, the non-MBS spectrum can be disaggregated when and if necessary to provide each with its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment. If the proponent chooses to effectuate a channel swap to <PRTPAGE P="386"/>provide more than one channel in the MBS, the remaining channels assigned to the group (after considering that one or more LBS/UBS channels and associated Transition Band channels will have been swapped away to provide the additional MBS channel) can be allocated among the licensees on a pro rata basis (with channel(s) in each segment being disaggregated when and if necessary to provide each with its pro rata share of the spectrum in each segment).</P>

                        <P>(i) The use of the LBS and/or UBS band for the point-to-point transmission of the EBS video or data (through superchannelization of the licensee's contiguous LBS or UBS channels), provided the proponent commits to retune the existing point-to-point equipment to operate on those channels or to replace the existing equipment with new equipment tuned to operate on those channels and the proposal complies with the LBS/UBS technical and interference protection rules;</P>
                        <P>(ii) The migration of the EBS programming to the MBS by retuning the existing point-to-point equipment to operate in the MBS or replacing it with equipment tuned to operate in the MBS; or</P>

                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Migration of Video Programming and Data Transmission Track.</E> (1) The proponent(s) must provide, at its cost, to each EBS licensee that intends to continue downstream high-power, high-site educational video programming or data transmission services, with one <PRTPAGE P="387"/>programming track on the MBS channels for each EBS video or data transmission track the licensee is transmitting on a simultaneous basis before the transition.</P>
                        <P>(i) To be eligible for migration, a program track must contain EBS programming that complies with § 27.1203 (b) and (c).</P>

                        <P>(C) Where in implementing the Transition Plan, the proponent(s) deploys precise frequency offset in an analog system, the minimum cochannel D/U ratio is reduced to 38 dB, provided that the transmitters have or are upgraded pursuant to the Transition Plan to have the appropriate “plus,” “zero,” or “minus” 10,010 Hertz precision frequency offset with a ±3 Hertz (or better) stability.</P>
                        <P>(ii) <E T="03">Adjacent Channel D/U Ratio.</E> The actual adjacent channel D/U must equal or exceed the lesser of 0 dB or the actual pre-transmission D/U ratio. However, in the event that the receive site uses receivers or is upgraded by the proponent(s) as part of the Transition Plan to use receivers that can tolerate negative adjacent channel D/U ratios, the actual adjacent channel D/U ratio at such receive site must equal or exceed -10 dB. Provided that the receive site receiver is not upgraded and cannot tolerate -10 dB, the adjacent channel D/U ratio would be 0dB.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Transition of the 2150-2160/62 MHz band from the Broadband Radio Service to the Advanced Wireless Service.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>The 2150-2160/62 MHz band has been allocated for use by the Advanced Wireless Service (AWS). The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which AWS licensees may relocate existing Broadband Radio Service (BRS) licensees using these frequencies to their assigned frequencies in the 2496-2690 MHz band or other media.</P>
                        <P>(a) AWS licensees and BRS licensees shall engage in mandatory negotiations for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the BRS licensees would:</P>
                        <P>(1) Relocate their operations to other frequency bands or other media; or alternatively</P>
                        <P>(2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the AWS licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the BRS operations.</P>
                        <P>(b) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation period, an AWS licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures. Under involuntary relocation, the incumbent is required to relocate, provided that the AWS licensee meets the conditions of § 27.1252.</P>
                        <P>(c) Relocation of BRS licensees by AWS licensees will be subject to a three-year mandatory negotiation period. BRS licensees may suspend the running of the three-year negotiation period for up to one year if the BRS licensee cannot be relocated to comparable facilities at the time the AWS licensee seeks entry into the band.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Mandatory Negotiations.</SUBJECT>

                        <P>(a) Once mandatory negotiations have begun, a BRS licensee may not refuse to negotiate and all parties are required to negotiate in good faith. Good faith requires each party to provide information to the other that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the relocation process. The BRS licensee is <PRTPAGE P="391"/>required to cooperate with an AWS licensee's request to provide access to the facilities to be relocated, other than the BRS customer location, so that an independent third party can examine the BRS system and prepare an appraisal of the costs to relocate the incumbent. In evaluating claims that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the FCC will consider, <E T="03">inter alia,</E> the following factors:</P>
                        <P>(1) Whether the AWS licensee has made a bona fide offer to relocate the BRS licensee to comparable facilities in accordance with § 27.1252(b);</P>

                        <P>(2) If the BRS licensee has demanded a premium, the type of premium requested (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, whether the premium is directly related to relocation, such as analog-to-digital conversions, versus other types of premiums), and whether the value of the premium as compared to the cost of providing comparable facilities is disproportionate (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, whether there is a lack of proportion or relation between the two);</P>
                        <P>(3) What steps the parties have taken to determine the actual cost of relocation to comparable facilities;</P>
                        <P>(4) Whether either party has withheld information requested by the other party that is necessary to estimate relocation costs or to facilitate the relocation process.</P>
                        <P>(b) Any party alleging a violation of our good faith requirement must attach an independent estimate of the relocation costs in question to any documentation filed with the Commission in support of its claim. An independent cost estimate must include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.</P>
                        <P>(c) Mandatory negotiations will commence for each BRS licensee when the AWS licensee informs the BRS licensee in writing of its desire to negotiate. Mandatory negotiations will be conducted with the goal of providing the BRS licensee with comparable facilities, defined as facilities possessing the following characteristics:</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Throughput.</E> Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. System is defined as a base station and all end user units served by that base station. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, comparable facilities may provide a comparable number of channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, comparable facilities provide equivalent data loading bits per second (bps).</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Reliability.</E> System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. Comparable facilities provide reliability equal to the overall reliability of the BRS system. For digital systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital video transmission, it is measured by whether the end-to-end transmission delay is within the required delay bound. If an analog system is replaced with a digital system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion, signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in determining comparable reliability.</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Operating Costs.</E> Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the BRS system. AWS licensees would compensate BRS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, additional rental payments, and increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. AWS licensees could satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the BRS licensee would be equivalent to the replaced system in order for the replacement system to be comparable.</P>
                        <P>(d) AWS licensees are responsible for the relocation costs of end user units served by the BRS base station that is being relocated. If a lessee is operating under a BRS license, the BRS licensee may rely on the throughput, reliability, and operating costs of facilities in use by a lessee in negotiating comparable facilities and may include the lessee in negotiations.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Involuntary Relocation Procedures.</SUBJECT>

                        <P>(a) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation period, an AWS licensee may initiate involuntary <PRTPAGE P="392"/>relocation procedures under the Commission's rules. AWS licensees are obligated to pay to relocate BRS systems to which the AWS system poses an interference problem. Under involuntary relocation, the BRS licensee is required to relocate, provided that the AWS licensee:</P>
                        <P>(1) Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expenses incurred by the BRS licensee that are directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of two percent of the “hard” costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as equipment and engineering expenses. There is no cap on the actual costs of relocation. AWS licensees are not required to pay BRS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process. AWS licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by BRS licensees during the mandatory period once the involuntary period is initiated, or for fees that cannot be legitimately tied to the provision of comparable facilities; and</P>
                        <P>(2) Completes all activities necessary for implementing the replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and frequency coordination.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Comparable facilities.</E> The replacement system provided to an incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent to the existing BRS system with respect to the following three factors:</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Throughput.</E> Communications throughput is the amount of information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. System is defined as a base station and all end user units served by that base station. If analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the AWS licensee is required to provide the BRS licensee with a comparable number of channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital, the AWS licensee must provide the BRS licensee with equivalent data loading bits per second (bps). AWS licensees must provide BRS licensees with enough throughput to satisfy the BRS licensee's system use at the time of relocation, not match the total capacity of the BRS system.</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Reliability.</E> System reliability is the degree to which information is transferred accurately within a system. AWS licensees must provide BRS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value, and for analog or digital video transmissions, it is measured by whether the end-to-end transmission delay is within the required delay bound.</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Operating costs.</E> Operating costs are the cost to operate and maintain the BRS system. AWS licensees must compensate BRS licensees for any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five years after relocation. AWS licensees may satisfy this obligation by making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the BRS licensee must be equivalent to the replaced system in order for the replacement system to be considered comparable.</P>
                        <P>(c) AWS licensees are responsible for the relocation costs of end user units served by the BRS base station that is being relocated. If a lessee is operating under a BRS license, the AWS licensee shall on the throughput, reliability, and operating costs of facilities in use by a lessee at the time of relocation in determining comparable facilities for involuntary relocation purposes.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Twelve-month trial period.</E> If, within one year after the relocation to new facilities, the BRS licensee demonstrates that the new facilities are not comparable to the former facilities, the AWS licensee must remedy the defects or pay to relocate the BRS licensee to one of the following: Its former or equivalent 2 GHz channels, another comparable frequency band, a land-line system, or any other facility that satisfies the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section. This trial period commences on the <PRTPAGE P="393"/>date that the BRS licensee begins full operation of the replacement system. If the BRS licensee has retained its 2 GHz authorization during the trial period, it must return the license to the Commission at the end of the twelve months.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Sunset Provisions.</SUBJECT>

                        <P>(a) BRS licensees will maintain primary status in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band unless and until an AWS licensee requires use of the spectrum. AWS licensees are not required to pay relocation costs after the relocation rules sunset (<E T="03">i.e.</E> fifteen years from the date the first AWS license is issued in the band). Once the relocation rules sunset, an AWS licensee may require the incumbent to cease operations, provided that the AWS licensee intends to turn on a system within interference range of the incumbent, as determined by § 27.1255. AWS licensee notification to the affected BRS licensee must be in writing and must provide the incumbent with no less than six months to vacate the spectrum. After the six-month notice period has expired, the BRS licensee must turn its license back into the Commission, unless the parties have entered into an agreement which allows the BRS licensee to continue to operate on a mutually agreed upon basis.</P>
                        <P>(b) If the parties cannot agree on a schedule or an alternative arrangement, requests for extension will be accepted and reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will grant such extensions only if the incumbent can demonstrate that:</P>

                        <P>(1) It cannot relocate within the six-month period (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, because no alternative spectrum or other reasonable option is available); and</P>
                        <P>(2) The public interest would be harmed if the incumbent is forced to terminate operations.</P>

                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Future licensing and modifications.</E> After June 23, 2006, all major modifications to existing BRS systems in use in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band will be authorized on a secondary basis to AWS systems, unless the incumbent affirmatively justifies primary status and the incumbent BRS licensee establishes that the modification would not add to the relocation costs of AWS licensees. Major modifications include the following:</P>
                        <P>(1) Additions of new transmit sites or base stations made after June 23, 2006;</P>

                        <P>(2) Changes to existing facilities made after June 23, 2006, that would increase the size or coverage of the service area, or interference potential, and that would also increase the throughput of an existing system (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, sector splits in the antenna system). Modifications to fully utilize the existing throughput of existing facilities (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, to add customers) will not be considered major modifications even if such changes increase the size or coverage of the service area, or interference potential.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Relocation Criteria for Broadband Radio Service Licensees in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) An AWS licensee in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, prior to initiating operations from any base or fixed station that is co-channel to the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, must relocate any incumbent BRS system that is within the line of sight of the AWS licensee's base or fixed station. For purposes of this section, a determination of whether an AWS facility is within the line of sight of a BRS system will be made as follows:</P>

                        <P>(1) For a BRS system using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band exclusively to provide one-way transmissions to subscribers, the AWS licensee will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's geographic service area (GSA), based on the following criteria: use of 9.1 meters (30 feet) for the receiving antenna height, use of the actual transmitting antenna height and terrain elevation, and assumption of 4/3 Earth radius propagation conditions. Terrain elevation data must be obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 3-second database. All coordinates used in carrying out the required <PRTPAGE P="394"/>analysis shall be based upon use of NAD-83.</P>

                        <P>(2) For all other BRS systems using the 2150-2160/62 MHz band, the AWS licensee will determine whether there is an unobstructed signal path (line of sight) to the incumbent licensee's receive station hub using the method prescribed in “Methods for Predicting Interference from Response Station Transmitters and to Response Station Hubs and for Supplying Data on Response Station Systems. MM Docket 97-217,” in Amendment of Parts 1, 21 and 74 to Enable Multipoint Distribution Service and Instructional Television Fixed Service Licensees to Engage in Fixed Two-Way Transmissions, MM Docket No. 97-217, <E T="03">Report and Order on Further Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,</E> 15 FCC Rcd 14566 at 14610, Appendix D.</P>
                        <P>(b) Any AWS licensee in the 2110-2180 MHz band that causes actual and demonstrable interference to a BRS licensee in the 2150-2160/62 MHz band must take steps to eliminate the harmful interference, up to and including relocation of the BRS licensee, regardless of whether it would be required to do so under paragraph (a), of this section.</P>

The Commission will act on the NSA within 60 days of receipt. The <PRTPAGE P="398"/>Commission may approve the NSA in its entirety, approve with modifications, or require the parties to address additional terms or re-draft existing terms within a specified timeframe. After the NSA is approved, the parties must execute the NSA and such other agreements as the Commission may require or allow, and submit executed copies to the Commission within 10 business days of approval.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Submission of disputed issues.</E> If the parties have not reached agreement on all terms of the NSA and related agreements by the end of the six-month period, they must notify the Commission not later than five business days after the expiration of the six-month period of the terms on which they have agreed, the nature of the remaining issues, each party's position on each issue, whether additional negotiation is likely to produce an agreement, and, if so, a proposed deadline for reaching agreement on the NSA. Authority is delegated jointly to the Chiefs of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau to resolve any remaining disputes.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Resolution of disputes.</E> Actions to resolve disputes may include, but are not limited to:</P>
                      <P>(1) Granting additional time for negotiation;</P>
                      <P>(2) Issuing a decision on the disputed issues and requiring the submission of a draft agreement consistent with the decision;</P>
                      <P>(3) Directing the parties to further brief the remaining issues in full for immediate Commission decision; and/or</P>
                      <P>(4) Immediate denial of the long-form application filed by the winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block license.</P>
                      <P>(g) <E T="03">Default by winning bidder for Upper 700 MHz D Block license.</E> If the winning bidder for the Upper 700 MHz D Block fails to comply with negotiation or dispute resolution requirements or fails to execute a Commission-approved NSA, its long form application will be denied. If the long form application of the winning bidder of the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is denied for any reason, including as a consequence of an action taken pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, it will be deemed to have defaulted under § 1.2109(c) of this chapter, and will be liable for the default payment specified in § 1.2104(g) of this chapter.</P>

                      <P>(4) <E T="03">Attribution of early build-out to national benchmarks.</E> Upon completion of construction, transfer of ownership to the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, and compensation as required herein, if applicable, the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may include the network constructed pursuant to the early build-out provisions herein for purposes of determining whether it has met its national build-out benchmarks and the build-out requirements of the NSA.</P>
                      <P>(5) <E T="03">Rights to build out and operate in areas without a build-out commitment.</E> In areas for which the NSA does not require the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee to build out the Shared Wireless Broadband Network, a public safety entity may build out and operate a separate, exclusive network in the 700 MHz public safety broadband spectrum at any time, provided the public safety entity has received the written approval of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and operates its independent network pursuant to a spectrum leasing arrangement into which the public safety entity has entered with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.</P>
                      <P>(i) Such leasing arrangement shall not require the approval or consent of the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee; however, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee must provide the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee with notice of the public safety entity's intent to construct in that area within 30 days of receipt of a request from a public safety entity seeking to exercise this option, and shall inform the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee of the public safety entity's anticipated build-out date(s).</P>
                      <P>(ii) Should the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, within 30 calendar days from receipt of notice of the public safety entity's intent to construct in that area, certify in writing to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee that it will build out the shared network in the area within a reasonable time of the anticipated build-out date(s), as determined by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee shall not allow the public safety entity to build and operate its own separate exclusive network in that area, provided that the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Public Safety Broadband Licensee execute an amendment to the NSA indicating the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee's commitment to build the network in that area. Such commitment shall become enforceable against the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee as part of its overall build-out requirements.</P>
                      <P>(iii) If the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee does not exercise its option to commit to build out the network in the requested area within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of the public safety entity's intent to construct in such area, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and the public safety entity may proceed with a spectrum leasing arrangement, which must be filed with the Commission prior to the public safety entity commencing any operations. The spectrum leasing arrangement must take the form of a spectrum manager leasing arrangement under the rules specified in § 1.9020 of this chapter, and incorporate the following conditions:</P>

                      <P>(A) The network must provide broadband operations;<PRTPAGE P="401"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(B) The network must be fully interoperable with the Shared Wireless Broadband Network;</P>
                      <P>(C) The network must be available for use by any public safety entity in the area;</P>
                      <P>(D) The network must satisfy any other terms or conditions required by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee; and</P>
                      <P>(E) The public safety entity must construct and place into operation its network within one year of the effective date of the spectrum manager leasing arrangement. If the public safety entity fails to place the network into operation within one year, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee shall terminate the spectrum leasing arrangement pursuant to § 1.9020(h)(3) of this chapter. The public safety entity may also seek extended implementation authority from the Commission pursuant to the requirements of § 90.629 of this chapter.</P>
                      <P>(6) Except as set forth herein, the separate network is not required to meet the other specifications of the Shared Wireless Broadband Network. Absent agreement of the public safety entity, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, and the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee, the separate network may not operate using any spectrum associated with the Upper 700 MHz D Block license.</P>
                      <P>(7) The Public Safety Broadband Licensee must file with the Commission any spectrum manager leasing arrangement as specified in § 1.9020(e) of this chapter; such filing shall identify the public safety entity leasing the spectrum, the particular areas of spectrum leased as part of this build-out option, and the specific network infrastructure and equipment deployed on such leased spectrum.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Background.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>The revised Uniform System of Accounts (USOA) is a historical financial accounting system which reports the results of operational and financial events in a manner which enables both management and regulators to assess these results within a specified accounting period. The USOA also provides the financial community and others with financial performance results. In order for an accounting system to fulfill these purposes, it must exhibit consistency and stability in financial reporting (including the results published for regulatory purposes). Accordingly, the USOA has been designed to reflect stable, recurring financial data based to the extent regulatory considerations permit upon the consistency of the well established body of accounting theories and principles commonly referred to as generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
                    </SECTION>
                    <SECTION>
                      <SECTNO>§ 32.2</SECTNO>
                      <SUBJECT>Basis of the accounts.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) The financial accounts of a company are used to record, in monetary terms, the basic transactions which occur. Certain natural groupings of these transactions are called (in different contexts) transaction cycles, business processes, functions or activities. The concept, however, is the same in each case; i.e., the natural groupings represent what happens within the company on a consistent and continuing basis. This repetitive nature of the natural groupings, over long periods of time, lends an element of stability to the financial account structure.</P>

                      <P>(b) Within the telecommunications industry companies, certain recurring functions (natural groupings) do take place in the course of providing products and services to customers. These accounts reflect, to the extent feasible, those functions. For example, the primary bases of the accounts containing the investment in telecommunications plant are the functions <E T="03">performed by</E> the assets. In addition, because of the anticipated effects of future innovations, the telecommunications plant accounts are intended to permit technological distinctions. Similarly, the primary bases of plant operations, customer operations and corporate operations expense accounts are the functions <E T="03">performed by</E> individuals. The revenue accounts, on the other hand, reflect a market perspective of natural groupings based primarily upon the products and services <E T="03">purchased by</E> customers.</P>

                      <P>(c) In the course of developing the bases for this account structure, several other alternatives were explored. It was, for example, determined that, because of the variety and continual changing of various cost allocation mechanisms, the financial accounts of a company should not reflect an <E T="03">a priori</E> allocation of revenues, investments or expenses to products or services, jurisdictions or organizational structures. (Note also § 32.14 (c) and (d) of subpart B.) It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not be recorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location, description or size.</P>
                      <P>(d) Care has been taken in this account structure to avoid confusing a function with an organizational responsibility, particularly as it relates to the expense accounts. Whereas in the past, specific organizations may have performed specific functions, the future environment with its increasing mechanization and other changes will result in entirely new or restructured organizations. Thus, any relationships drawn between organizations and accounts would become increasingly meaningless with the passage of time.</P>
                      <P>(e) These accounts, then, are intended to reflect a functional and technological view of the telecommunications industry. This view will provide a stable and consistent foundation for the recording of financial data.</P>
                      <P>(f) The financial data contained in the accounts, together with the detailed information contained in the underlying financial and other subsidiary records required by this Commission, will provide the information necessary to support separations, cost of service and management reporting requirements. The basic account structure has been designed to remain stable as reporting requirements change.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Classification of companies.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) For purposes of this section, the term “company” or “companies” means incumbent local exchange carrier(s) as defined in section 251(h) of the Communications Act, and any other carriers that the Commission designates by Order. Incumbent local exchange carriers' successor or assign companies, as defined in section 251(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the Communications Act, that are found to be non-dominant by the Commission, will not be subject to this Uniform System of Accounts.</P>
                      <P>(b) For accounting purposes, companies are divided into classes as follows:</P>
                      <P>(1) <E T="03">Class A.</E> Companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations that are equal to or above the indexed revenue threshold.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Class B.</E> Companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations that are less than the indexed revenue threshold.</P>
                      <P>(c) Class A companies, except mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers, as defined by § 32.9000, shall keep all the accounts of this system of accounts which are applicable to their affairs and are designated as Class A accounts. Class A companies, which include mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers, shall keep Basic Property Records in compliance with the requirements of §§ 32.2000(e) and (f).</P>
                      <P>(d) Class B companies and mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers, as defined by § 32.9000, shall keep all accounts of this system of accounts which are applicable to their affairs and are designated as Class B accounts. Mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers shall also maintain subsidiary record categories necessary to provide the pole attachment data currently provided in the Class A accounts. Class B companies shall keep Continuing Property Records in compliance with the requirements of §§ 32.2000(e)(7)(i)(A) and 32.2000(f).</P>
                      <P>(e) Class B companies and mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers, as defined by § 32.9000 of this part, that desire more detailed accounting may adopt the accounts prescribed for Class A companies upon the submission of a written notification to the Commission.</P>
                      <P>(f) The classification of a company shall be determined at the start of the calendar year following the first time its annual operating revenue from regulated telecommunications operations equals, exceeds, or falls below the indexed revenue threshold.</P>

                      <P>(a) The company's financial records shall be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to the extent permitted by this system of accounts.</P>
                      <P>(b) The company's financial records shall be kept with sufficient particularity to show fully the facts pertaining to all entries in these accounts. The detail records shall be filed in such manner as to be readily accessible for examination by representatives of this Commission.</P>
                      <P>(c) The Commission shall require a company to maintain financial and other subsidiary records in such a manner that specific information, of a type not warranting disclosure as an account or subaccount, will be readily available. When this occurs, or where the full information is not otherwise recorded in the general books, the subsidiary records shall be maintained in sufficient detail to facilitate the reporting of the required specific information. The subsidiary records, in which the full details are shown, shall be sufficiently referenced to permit ready identification and examination by representatives of this Commission.</P>

                      <P>(a) As a general rule, all accounts kept by reporting companies shall conform in numbers and titles to those prescribed herein. However, reporting companies may use different numbers for internal purposes when separate accounts (or subaccounts) maintained are consistent with the title and content of accounts and subaccounts prescribed in this system.</P>
                      <P>(1) A company may subdivide any of the accounts prescribed. The titles of all such subaccounts shall refer by number or title to the controlling account.</P>
                      <P>(2) A company may establish temporary or experimental accounts without prior notice to the Commission.</P>

                      <P>(c) As of the date a company becomes subject to the system of accounts, the company is authorized to make any such subdivisions, reclassifications or consolidations of existing balances as are necessary to meet the requirements of this system of accounts.</P>
                      <P>(d) Nothing contained in this part shall prohibit or excuse any company, receiver, or operating trustee of any carrier from subdividing the accounts hereby prescribed for the purpose of:</P>
                      <P>(1) Complying with the requirements of the state commission(s) having jurisdiction; or</P>
                      <P>(2) Securing the information required in the prescribed reports to such commission(s).</P>
                      <P>(e) Where the use of subsidiary records is considered necessary in order to secure the information required in reports to any state commission, the company shall incorporate the following controls into their accounting system with respect to such subsidiary records:</P>
                      <P>(1) Subsidiary records shall be reconciled to the company's general ledger or books of original entry, as appropriate.</P>
                      <P>(2) The company shall adequately document the accounting procedures related to subsidiary records.</P>
                      <P>(3) The subsidiary records shall be maintained at an adequate level of detail to satisfy state regulators.</P>

                      <P>(a) In the context of this part, the regulated accounts shall be interpreted to include the investments, revenues and expenses associated with those telecommunications products and services to which the tariff filing requirements contained in Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, are applied, except as may be otherwise provided by the Commission. Regulated telecommunications products and services are thereby fully subject to the accounting requirements as specified in Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and as detailed in subparts A through F of this part of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.</P>

                      <P>(b) In addition to those amounts considered to be regulated by the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, those telecommunications products <PRTPAGE P="407"/>and services to which the tariff filing requirements of the several state jurisdictions are applied shall be accounted for as regulated, except where such treatment is proscribed or otherwise excluded from the requirements pertaining to regulated telecommunications products and services by this Commission.</P>
                      <P>(c) In the application of detailed accounting requirements contained in this part, when a regulated activity involves the common or joint use of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and nonregulated products and services, companies shall account for these activities within the accounts prescribed in this system for telephone company operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in subsidiary records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated activities, amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and amounts related to assets used and expenses incurred jointly or in common, which will be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. Companies shall submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated amounts in the manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. Nonregulated revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment, as provided in § 32.4999(l), shall be recorded in Account 5280, Nonregulated operating revenue.</P>
                      <P>(d) Other income items which are incidental to the provision of regulated products and services shall be accounted for as regulated activities.</P>
                      <P>(e) All costs and revenues related to the offering of regulated products and services which result from arrangements for joint participation or apportionment between two or more telephone companies (e.g., joint operating agreements, settlement agreements, cost-pooling agreements) shall be recorded within the detailed accounts. Under joint operating agreements, the creditor will initially charge the entire expenses to the appropriate primary accounts. The proportion of such expenses borne by the debtor shall be credited by the creditor and charged by the debtor to the account initially charged. Any allowances for return on property used will be accounted for as provided in Account 5200, Miscellaneous revenue.</P>
                      <P>(f) All items of nonregulated revenue, investment and expense that are not properly includible in the detailed, regulated accounts prescribed in subparts A through F of this part, as determined by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall be accounted for and included in reports to this Commission as specified in § 32.23 of this subpart.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Comprehensive interperiod tax allocation.</SUBJECT>

                      <P>(a) Companies shall apply interperiod tax allocation (tax normalization) to all book/tax temporary differences which would be considered material for published financial report purposes. Furthermore, companies shall also apply interperiod tax allocation if any item or group of similar items when aggregated would yield debit or credit entries which exceed or would exceed 5 percent of the gross deferred income tax expense debits or credits during any calendar year over the life of the temporary difference. The tax effects of book/tax temporary differences shall be normalized and the deferrals shall be included in the following accounts:

The amount recorded in the subsidiary record should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is likely to be realized.</P>

                      <P>(d) The records supporting the activity in the deferred income tax accounts <PRTPAGE P="409"/>shall be maintained in sufficient detail to identify the nature of the specific temporary differences giving rise to both the debits and credits to the individual accounts.</P>
                      <P>(e) Any company that uses accelerated depreciation (or recognizes taxable income or losses upon the retirement of property) for income tax purposes shall normalize the tax differentials occasioned thereby as indicated in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(1) With respect to the retirement of property the book/tax difference between (i) the recognition of proceeds as income and the accrual for salvage value and (ii) the book and tax capital recovery, shall be normalized.</P>

When property is transferred to nonregulated activities, the associated deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits shall also be identified and transferred to the appropriate nonregulated accounts.</P>

If the deferred income taxes are recorded as a reduction of the appropriate plant accounts, such reduction shall be treated as reducing the original cost of the plant and accounted for as such.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Nonregulated activities.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) This section describes the accounting treatment of activities classified for accounting purposes as “nonregulated.” Preemptively deregulated activities and activities (other than incidental activities) never subject to regulation will be classified for accounting purposes as “nonregulated.” Activities that qualify for incidental treatment under the policies of this Commission will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated activities. Activities that have been deregulated by a state will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated activities. Activities that have been deregulated at the interstate level, but not preemptively deregulated, will be classified for accounting purposes as regulated activities until such time as this Commission decides otherwise. The treatment of nonregulated activities shall differ depending on the extent of the common or joint use of assets and resources in the provision of both regulated and nonregulated products and services.</P>
                      <P>(b) When a nonregulated activity does not involve the joint or common use of assets and resources in the provision of both regulated and nonregulated products and services, carriers shall account for these activities on a separate set of books consistent with instructions set forth in §§ 32.1406 and 32.7990. Transfers of assets, and sales of products and services between the regulated activity and a nonregulated activity for which a separate set of books is maintained, shall be accounted for in accordance with the rules presented in § 32.27, Transactions with Affiliates. In the separate set of books, carriers may establish whatever detail they deem appropriate beyond what is necessary to provide this Commission with the information required in §§ 32.1406 and 32.7990.</P>

                      <P>(c) When a nonregulated activity does involve the joint or common use of assets and resources in the provision of regulated and nonregulated products <PRTPAGE P="410"/>and services, carriers shall account for these activities within accounts prescribed in this system for telephone company operations. Assets and expenses shall be subdivided in subsidiary records among amounts solely assignable to nonregulated activities, amounts solely assignable to regulated activities, and amounts related to assets and expenses incurred jointly or in common, which will be allocated between regulated and nonregulated activities. Carriers shall submit reports identifying regulated and nonregulated amounts in the manner and at the times prescribed by this Commission. Nonregulated revenue items not qualifying for incidental treatment as provided in § 32.4999(l) of this part, shall be recorded in separate subsidiary record categories of Account 5280, Nonregulated operating revenue. Amounts assigned or allocated to regulated products or services shall be subject to part 36 of this chapter.</P>

                      <P>(a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, transactions with affiliates involving asset transfers into or out of the regulated accounts shall be recorded by the carrier in its regulated accounts as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(b) Assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Non-tariffed assets sold or transferred between a carrier and its affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing price. For all other assets sold by or transferred from a carrier to its affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at no less than the higher of fair market value and net book cost. For all other assets sold by or transferred to a carrier from its affiliate, the assets shall be recorded at no more than the lower of fair market value and net book cost.</P>
                      <P>(1) <E T="03">Floor.</E> When assets are sold by or transferred from a carrier to an affiliate, the higher of fair market value and net book cost establishes a floor, below which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or greater than the floor, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Ceiling.</E> When assets are purchased from or transferred from an affiliate to a carrier, the lower of fair market value and net book cost establishes a <PRTPAGE P="411"/>ceiling, above which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or less than the ceiling, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Threshold.</E> For purposes of this section carriers are required to make a good faith determination of fair market value for an asset when the total aggregate annual value of the asset(s) reaches or exceeds $500,000, per affiliate. When a carrier reaches or exceeds the $500,000 threshold for a particular asset for the first time, the carrier must perform the market valuation and value the transaction on a going-forward basis in accordance with the affiliate transactions rules on a going-forward basis. When the total aggregate annual value of the asset(s) does not reach or exceed $500,000, the asset(s) shall be recorded at net book cost.</P>
                      <P>(c) Services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant to a tariff, including a tariff filed with a state commission, shall be recorded in the appropriate revenue accounts at the tariffed rate. Non-tariffed services provided between a carrier and its affiliate pursuant to publicly-filed agreements submitted to a state commission pursuant to section 252(e) of the Communications Act of 1934 or statements of generally available terms pursuant to section 252(f) shall be recorded using the charges appearing in such publicly-filed agreements or statements. Non-tariffed services provided between a carrier and its affiliate that qualify for prevailing price valuation, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be recorded at the prevailing price. For all other services sold by or transferred from a carrier to its affiliate, the services shall be recorded at no less than the higher of fair market value and fully distributed cost. For all other services sold by or transferred to a carrier from its affiliate, the services shall be recorded at no more than the lower of fair market value and fully distributed cost.</P>
                      <P>(1) <E T="03">Floor.</E> When services are sold by or transferred from a carrier to an affiliate, the higher of fair market value and fully distributed cost establishes a floor, below which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or greater than the floor, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Ceiling.</E> When services are purchased from or transferred from an affiliate to a carrier, the lower of fair market value and fully distributed cost establishes a ceiling, above which the transaction cannot be recorded. Carriers may record the transaction at an amount equal to or less than the ceiling, so long as that action complies with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Commission rules and orders, and is not otherwise anti-competitive.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Threshold.</E> For purposes of this section, carriers are required to make a good faith determination of fair market value for a service when the total aggregate annual value of that service reaches or exceeds $500,000, per affiliate. When a carrier reaches or exceeds the $500,000 threshold for a particular service for the first time, the carrier must perform the market valuation and value the transaction in accordance with the affiliate transactions rules on a going-forward basis. All services received by a carrier from its affiliate(s) that exist solely to provide services to members of the carrier's corporate family shall be recorded at fully distributed cost.</P>
                      <P>(d) In order to qualify for prevailing price valuation in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, sales of a particular asset or service to third parties must encompass greater than 25 percent of the total quantity of such product or service sold by an entity. Carriers shall apply this 25 percent threshold on an asset-by-asset and service-by-service basis, rather than on a product-line or service-line basis. In the case of transactions for assets and services subject to section 272, a BOC may record such transactions at prevailing price regardless of whether the 25 percent threshold has been satisfied.</P>

                      <P>(e) Income taxes shall be allocated among the regulated activities of the carrier, its nonregulated divisions, and <PRTPAGE P="412"/>members of an affiliated group. Under circumstances in which income taxes are determined on a consolidated basis by the carrier and other members of the affiliated group, the income tax expense to be recorded by the carrier shall be the same as would result if determined for the carrier separately for all time periods, except that the tax effect of carry-back and carry-forward operating losses, investment tax credits, or other tax credits generated by operations of the carrier shall be recorded by the carrier during the period in which applied in settlement of the taxes otherwise attributable to any member, or combination of members, of the affiliated group.</P>
                      <P>(f) Companies that employ average schedules in lieu of actual costs are exempt from the provisions of this section. For other organizations, the principles set forth in this section shall apply equally to corporations, proprietorships, partnerships and other forms of business organizations.</P>

                      <P>(4) Cost of evaluations, inventories, and appraisals taken in connection with the acquisition or sale of property. If the property is subsequently acquired, the preliminary costs shall be accounted for as a part of the cost of acquisition, or if it is sold, such costs shall be deducted from the sale price in accounting for the property sold. If purchases or sales are abandoned, the preliminary costs included herein (including options paid, if any) shall be charged to Account 7300.</P>
                      <P>(b) Charges provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be included in this account only upon direction or approval from this Commission. However, the company's application to this Commission for such approval shall give full particulars concerning the property retired, the extensive replacements, the amount chargeable to operating expenses and the period over which in its judgment the amount of such charges should be distributed.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Instructions for telecommunications plant accounts.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose of telecommunications plant accounts.</E> (1) The telecommunications plant accounts (2001 to 2007 inclusive) are designed to show the investment in the company's tangible and intangible telecommunications plant which ordinarily has a service life of more than one year, including such plant whether used by the company or others in providing telecommunications service.</P>
                      <P>(2) The telecommunications plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of telecommunications plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of telecommunications plant shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Amounts of non-recurring reimbursements based on the cost of plant or equipment furnished in rendering service to a customer shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of the plant or equipment. Amounts received for construction which are ultimately to be repaid wholly or in part, shall be credited to Account 4300, Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits; when final determination has been made as to the amount to be returned, any unrefunded amounts shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Amounts received for the construction of plant, the ownership of which rests with or will revert to others, shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. (Note also Account 7100, Other operating income and expense.)</P>

                      <P>(3) When telecommunications plant ordinarily having a service life of more <PRTPAGE P="418"/>than one year is installed for temporary use in providing telecommunications service, it shall be accounted for in the same manner as plant having a service life of more than one year. This includes temporary installations of plant (such as poles, wire and cable) installed to maintain service during the progress of highway reconstruction or during interruptions due to storms or other casualties, equipment used for the training of operators, equipment used to provide intercepting positions in central offices to handle traffic for a short period following extensive system changes and similar installations of property used to provide telecommunications service.</P>
                      <P>(4) The cost of the individual items of equipment, classifiable to Accounts 2112, Motor vehicles; 2113, Aircraft; 2114, Tools and other work equipment; 2122, Furniture; 2123, Office equipment; 2124, General purpose computers, costing $2,000 or less or having a life of less than one year shall be charged to the applicable expense accounts, except for personal computers falling within Account 2124. Personal computers classifiable to Account 2124, with a total cost for all components of $500 or less, shall be charged to the applicable Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts. The cost of tools and test equipment located in the central office, classifiable to central office asset accounts 2210-2232 costing $2,000 or less or having a life of less than one year shall be charged to the applicable Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts. If the aggregate investment in the items is relatively large at the time of acquisition, such amounts shall be maintained in an applicable material and supplies account until items are used.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Telecommunications plant acquired.</E> (1) Property, plant and equipment acquired from an entity, whether or not affiliated with the accounting company, shall be accounted for at original cost, except that property, plant and equipment acquired from a nonaffiliated entity shall be accounted for at acquisition cost if the purchase price is less than $100,000 for Class A companies or $25,000 for Class B companies.</P>
                      <P>(2) The accounting for property, plant and equipment to be recorded at original cost shall be as follows:</P>
                      <P>(i) The amount of money paid (or current money value of any consideration other than money exchanged) for the property (together with preliminary expenses incurred in connection the acquisition) shall be charged to Account 1438, Deferred maintenance, retirements, and other deferred charges.</P>
                      <P>(ii) The original cost, estimated if not known, of telecommunications plant, governmental franchises and other similar rights acquired shall be charged to the applicable telecommunications plant accounts, Telecommunications Plant Under Construction, and Property Held For Future Telecommunications Use, as appropriate, and credited to Account 1439. When the actual original cost cannot be determined and estimates are used, the company shall be prepared to furnish the Commission with the particulars of such estimates.</P>
                      <P>(iii) Accumulated Depreciation and amortization balances related to plant acquired shall be credited to Account 3100, Accumulated depreciation, or Account 3200, Accumulated depreciation—held for future telecommunications use, or Account 3410, Accumulated amortization—capitalized leases and debited to Account 1438. Accumulated amortization balances related to plant acquired which ultimately is recorded in Accounts 2005, Telecommunications plant adjustment, Account 2682, Leasehold improvements, or Account 2690, Intangibles shall be credited to these asset accounts, and debited to Account 1438.</P>
                      <P>(iv) Any amount remaining in Account 1438, applicable to the plant acquired, shall, upon completion of the entries provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iii) of this section, be debited or credited, as applicable, to Account 2007, Goodwill, or to Account 2005, Telecommunications plant adjustment, as appropriate.</P>
                      <P>(3) A memorandum record shall be kept showing the amount of contributions in aid of construction applicable to the property acquired as shown by the accounts of the previous owner.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Cost of construction.</E> (1) Telecommunications plant represents an <PRTPAGE P="419"/>economic resource which will be used to provide future services, the cost of which will be allocated in a rational and systematic manner to the future periods in which it provides benefits. In accounting for construction costs, the utility shall charge to the telecommunications plant accounts, where applicable, all direct and indirect costs.</P>
                      <P>(2) Direct and indirect costs shall include, but not be limited to:</P>
                      <P>(i) “Labor” includes the wages and expenses of employees directly engaged in or in direct charge of construction work. It includes expenses directly related to an employee's wages, such as worker's compensation insurance, payroll taxes, benefits and other similar items of expense.</P>
                      <P>(ii) “Engineering” includes the portion of the wages and expenses of engineers, draftsmen, inspectors, and their direct supervision applicable to construction work. It includes expenses directly related to an employee's wages, such as worker's compensation insurance, payroll taxes, benefits and other similar items of expense.</P>
                      <P>(iii) “Material and supplies” includes the purchase price of material used at the point of free delivery plus the costs of inspection, loading and transportation, and an equitable portion of provisioning expense. In determining the cost of material used, proper allowance shall be made for unused material, for material recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of material. This item does not include construction material that is stolen or rendered unusable due to vandalism. Such material should be charged to the applicable plant specific operations expense accounts.</P>
                      <P>(iv) “Transportation” includes the cost of transporting employees, material and supplies, tools and other work equipment to and from the physical construction location. It includes amounts paid therefor to other companies or individuals and the cost of using the company's own motor vehicles or other transportation equipment.</P>
                      <P>(v) “Contract work” includes amounts paid for work performed under contract or other agreement by other companies, firms or individuals; engineering and supervision applicable to such work; cost incident to the award of contracts; and the inspection of such work. The cost of construction work performed by affiliated companies and other details relating thereto shall be available from the work in progress and supporting records.</P>
                      <P>(vi) “Protection” includes the cost of protecting the company's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others or the property of others.</P>
                      <P>(vii) “Privileges, Permits, and Rights of way” includes such costs incurred in obtaining these privileges, permits, or rights of way in connection with construction work, such as for use of private property, streets or highways. The cost of such privileges and permits shall be included in the cost of the work for which the privileges or permits are obtained, except for costs includable in Account 2111, Land, and Account 2690, Intangibles.</P>
                      <P>(viii) “Taxes” includes taxes properly includable in construction costs before the facilities are completed for service, which taxes are assessed separately from taxes on operating property or under conditions that permit separate identification of the amount chargeable to construction.</P>
                      <P>(ix) “Special machine service” includes the cost of labor expended, materials and supplies consumed and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special and other labor saving machines (other than transportation equipment (such as trenching equipment, cable plows and pole setting trucks. Also included are expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of such machines owned by others. When a construction job requires the purchase of special machines, the cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value at the time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of construction.</P>

                      <P>(x) Allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”) provides for the cost of financing the construction of telecommunications plant. AFUDC shall be charged to Account 2003, Telecommunications plant under construction, and credited to Account 7300, <PRTPAGE P="420"/>Nonoperating income and expense. The rate for calculating AFUDC shall be determined as follows: If financing plans associate a specific new borrowing with an asset, the rate on that borrowing may be used for the asset; if no specific new borrowing is associated with an asset or if the average accumulated expenditures for the asset exceed the amounts of specific new borrowing associated with it, the capitalization rate to be applied to such excess shall be the weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the enterprise. The amount of interest cost capitalized in an accounting period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost incurred by the company in that period.</P>
                      <P>(xi) “Insurance” includes premiums paid specifically for protection against loss and damage in connection with the construction of telecommunications plant due to fire or other casualty, injury to or death of employees or others, damages to property of others, defalcations of employees and agents and the non-performance of contractual obligations of others.</P>
                      <P>(xii) “Construction services” include the cost of telephone, electricity, power, construction quarters, office space and equipment directly related to the construction project.</P>
                      <P>(xiii) “Indirect construction costs” shall include indirect costs such as general engineering, supervision and support. Such costs, in addition to direct supervision, shall include indirect plant operations and engineering supervision up to, but not including, supervision by executive officers whose pay and expenses are chargeable to Account 6720, General and administrative. The records supporting the entries for indirect construction costs shall be kept so as to show the nature of the expenditures, the individual jobs and accounts charged, and the bases of the distribution. The amounts charged to each plant account for indirect costs shall be readily determinable. The instructions contained herein shall not be interpreted as permitting the addition to plant of amounts to cover indirect costs based on arbitrary allocations.</P>
                      <P>(xiv) The cost of construction shall not include any amounts classifiable as Corporate Operations Expense.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Telecommunications plant retired.</E> (1) Telecommunications plant accounts shall at all times disclose the original cost of all property in service. When any item of property subject to plant retirement accounting is worn out, lost, sold, destroyed, abandoned, surrendered upon lapse of title, becomes permanently unserviceable, is withdrawn or for any other reason is retired from service, the plant accounts applicable to that item shall be credited with the original cost of the plant retired whether replaced or not (except as provided for minor items in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section). Normally, these retirement credits with respect to such plant as entire buildings, entire central offices, all plant abandoned and any large sections of plant withdrawn from service, shall be entered in the accounts for the month in which use of the property ceased. For any other plant withdrawn from service, the retirement credits shall be entered no later than the next succeeding month. Literal compliance with the provision for timing of entries with respect to property amounting to less than $50,000 retired under any one project is not required if an unreasonable amount of recordkeeping and estimating of quantities, original costs and salvage is necessary. The retirement entry shall refer to the continuing property record, or records supplemental thereto, from which the cost was obtained (note also paragraph (d)(3) of this section). Every company shall establish procedures which will ensure compliance with these requirements.</P>
                      <P>(2) To avoid undue refinement, depreciable telecommunications plant shall be accounted for as follows:</P>
                      <P>(i) <E T="03">Retirement units:</E> This group includes major items of property, a representative list of which shall be prescribed by this Commission. In lieu of the retirement units prescribed with respect to a particular account, a company may, after obtaining specific approval by this Commission, establish and maintain its own list of retirement units for a portion or all of the plant in any such account. For items included <PRTPAGE P="421"/>on the retirement units list, the original cost of any such items retired shall be credited to the plant account and charged to Account 3100 Accumulated Depreciation, whether or not replaced. The original cost of retirement units installed in place of property retired shall be charged to the applicable telecommunications plant account.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Minor items: This group includes any part or element of plant which is not designated as a retirement unit. The original cost of a minor item of property when included in the specific or average cost for a retirement unit or units requires no separate credit to the telecommunications plant account when such a minor item is retired. The cost of replacement shall be charged to the account applicable for the cost of repairs of the property. However, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, of greater durability, of greater capacity or more economical in operation), the excess cost of such a replacement, over the estimated cost at the then current prices of replacement without betterment of the minor items being retired, shall be charged to the applicable telecommunications plant account.</P>
                      <P>(3) The cost of property to be retired shall be the amount at which property is included in the telecommunications plant accounts. However, when it is impracticable to determine the cost of each item due to the relatively large number or small cost of such items, the average cost of all the items covered by an appropriate subdivision of the account shall be used in determining the cost to be assigned to such items when retired. The method used in determining average cost must give due regard to the quantity, vintage, size and kind of items, the area in which they were installed and their classification in other respects. Average cost may be applied in retirement of such items as poles, wire, cable, cable terminals, conduit and booths. Any company may use average cost of property installed in a year or band of years as approved by the Commission. It should be understood, however, that the use of average costs shall not relieve the company of the requirement for maintaining its continuing property records to show, where practicable, dates of installation and removal for purposes of mortality studies. (See § 32.2000(f) of this subpart, Standard Practices for Establishing and Maintaining Continuing Property Records.)</P>
                      <P>(4) The accounting for the retirement of property, plant and equipment shall be as provided above except that amounts in Account 2111, Land, and amounts for works of art recorded in Account 2122, Furniture, shall be treated at disposition as a gain or loss and shall be credited or debited to Account 7100, Other operating income and expense, as applicable. If land or artwork is retained by the company and held for sale, the cost shall be charged to Account 2006, Nonoperating plant.</P>
                      <P>(5) When the telecommunications plant is sold together with traffic associated therewith, the original cost of the property shall be credited to the applicable plant accounts and the estimated amounts carried with respect thereto in the accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts shall be charged to such accumulated accounts. The difference, if any, between the net amount of such debit and credit items and the consideration received (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) for the property shall be included in Account 7300, Nonoperating income and expense. The accounting for depreciable telecommunications plant sold without the traffic associated therewith shall be in accordance with the accounting provided in § 32.3100(c).</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Basic property records.</E> (1) The basic property records are that portion of the total property accounting system which preserves the following detailed information:</P>
                      <P>(i) The identity, vintage, location and original cost of units of property;</P>
                      <P>(ii) Original and ongoing transactional data (plant account activity) in terms of such units; and</P>

                      <P>(iii) Any other specific financial and cost accounting information not properly warranting separate disclosure as an account or subaccount but which is needed to support regulatory, cost, tax, management and other specific accounting information needs and requirements.<PRTPAGE P="422"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(2) The basic property records must be: (i) Subject to internal accounting controls, (ii) auditable, (iii) equal in the aggregate to the total investment reflected in the financial property control accounts as well as the total of the cost allocations supporting the determination of cost-of-service at any particular point in time, and (iv) maintained throughout the life of the property.</P>
                      <P>(3) The basic property records shall consist of (i) continuing property records and (ii) records supplemental thereto which together reveal clearly, by accounting area, the detailed and systematically summarized information necessary to meet fully the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(4) Companies shall establish and maintain basic property records for each class of property recorded in the several plant accounts which comprise the balance sheet Account 2001, Telecommunications Plant In Service, Account 2002, Property Held for Future Telecommunications Use, and Account 2006, Nonoperating Plant.</P>
                      <P>(5) The company shall notify the Commission of a plan for the basic property record as follows:</P>
                      <P>(i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which it becomes subject to this system of accounts, the company shall file with the Commission two (2) copies of a complete plan of the method to be used in the compilation of a basic property record with respect to each class of property. The plan shall include a list of proposed accounting areas accompanied by description of the boundaries of each area as defined in accordance with the requirements of § 32.2000(f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this subpart. The plan shall also include a list of property record units proposed for use under each regulated plant account. These property record units shall be selected such that the requirements of § 32.2000(f)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subpart can be satisfied.</P>
                      <P>(ii) The company shall submit to the Commission one copy of any major proposed changes in its basic property record plan at least 30 days before the effective date of the proposed changes.</P>
                      <P>(6) The company shall prepare and maintain the basic property record as follows:</P>
                      <P>(i) Not later than June 30 of the year following that in which the company becomes subject to this system of accounts, begin the preparation of a basic property record.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Complete within two years of the prescribed beginning date, basic property records for all property as of the end of the preceding calendar year.</P>
                      <P>(iii) Promptly process in the basic property records all property changes affecting periods subsequent to initial establishment of the basic property record.</P>
                      <P>(7) The basic property record components (see paragraph (c) of this section) shall be arranged in conformity with the regulated plant accounts prescribed in this section of accounts as follows:</P>
                      <P>(i) The continuing property records shall be compiled on the basis of original cost (or other book cost consistent with this system of accounts). The continuing property records shall be maintained as prescribed in § 32.2000(f)(2)(iii) of this subpart in such manner as will meet the following basic objectives:</P>
                      <P>(A) Provide for the verification of property record units by physical examination.</P>
                      <P>(B) Provide for accurate accounting for retirements.</P>
                      <P>(C) Provide data for use in connection with depreciation studies.</P>
                      <P>(ii) The records supplemental to the continuing property records shall disclose such service designations, usage measurement criteria, apportionment factors, or other data as may be prescribed by the Commission in this part or other parts of its Rules and Regulations. Such data are subject to the same general controls and standards for auditability and support as are all other elements of the basic property records.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Standard practices for establishing and maintaining continuing property records</E>—(1) <E T="03">Accounting area.</E> (i) The continuing property record, as related to each primary plant account, shall be established and maintained by subaccounts for each accounting area. An <PRTPAGE P="423"/>accounting area is the smallest territory of the company for which accounting records of investment are maintained for all plant accounts within the area. Areas already established for administrative, accounting, valuation, or other purposes may be adopted for this purpose when appropriate. In no case shall the boundaries of accounting areas cross either State lines or boundaries prescribed by the Commission.</P>
                      <P>(ii) In determining the limit of each area, consideration shall be given to the quantities of property, construction conditions, operating districts, county and township lines, taxing district boundaries, city limits, and other political or geographical limits, in order that the area adopted may have maximum adaptability, within the confines of practicability, for both the company's purpose and those of Federal, State, and municipal authorities.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Property record units.</E> (i) In each of the established accounting areas, the “property record units” which are to be maintained in the continuing property record shall be set forth separately, classified by size and type with the amount of original cost (or other appropriate book cost) associated with such units. When a list of property record units has been accepted by the Commission, they shall become the units referred to in this statement of standard practices. Such units shall apply to only the regulated portion of this system of accounts.</P>
                      <P>(ii) When it is found necessary to revise this list because of the addition of units used in providing new types of service, or new units resulting from improvements in technology, or because of the grouping or elimination of units which no longer merit separate recognition as property record units, one copy of such changes shall be submitted to the Commission. Upon appropriate showing by the company, the Commission may specifically exempt the company from these filing requirements.</P>
                      <P>(iii) The continuing property record shall reveal the description, location, date of placement, the essential details of construction, and the original cost (note also § 32.2000(f)(3) of this subpart) of the property record units. The continuing property record and other underlying records of construction costs shall be so maintained that, upon retirement of one or more retirement units or of minor items without replacement when not included in the costs of retirement units, the actual cost or a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of the plant retired can be determined.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Methods of determining original cost of property record units.</E> The original cost of the property record units shall be determined by analyses of the construction costs incurred as shown by completion reports and other data, accumulated in the respective construction work orders or authorizations. Costs shall be allocated to and associated with the property record units to facilitate accounting for retirements. The original cost of property record units shall be determined by unit identification or averaging as described in paragraphs (f)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(i) <E T="03">Unit identification.</E> Cost shall be identified and maintained by specific location for property record units contained within certain regulated plant accounts or account groupings such as Land, Buildings, Central Office Assets, Motor Vehicles, garage work equipment included in Account 2114, Tools and other work equipment, and Furniture. In addition, units involved in any unusual or special type of construction shall be recorded by their specific location costs (note also § 32.2000(f)(3)(ii)(B)).</P>
                      <P>(ii) <E T="03">Averaging.</E> (A) Average costs may be developed for plant consisting of a large number of similar units such as terminal equipment, poles, wire, cable, cable terminals, conduit, furniture, and work equipment. Units of similar size and type within each specified accounting area and regulated plant account may be grouped. Each such average cost shall be set forth in the continuing property record of the units with which it is associated.</P>

                      <P>(B) The averaging of costs permitted under the provisions of the foregoing paragraph is restricted to plant installed in a particular vintage or band of years incurred within an accounting area. This paragraph does not permit the inclusion of the cost of units involved in any unusual or special type <PRTPAGE P="424"/>of construction. The units involved in such unusual or special type of construction shall be recorded at cost by location.</P>
                      <P>(4) <E T="03">Estimates.</E> In cases where the actual original cost of property cannot be ascertained, such as pricing an inventory for the initial entry of a continuing property record or the pricing of an acquisition for which a continuing property record has not been maintained, the original cost may be estimated. Any estimated original cost shall be consistent with the accounting practices in effect at the time the property was constructed.</P>
                      <P>(5) <E T="03">Identification of property record units.</E> There shall be shown in the continuing property record or in record supplements thereof, a complete description of the property records units in such detail as to identify such units. The description shall include the identification of the work order under which constructed, the year of installation (unless not determinable per § 32.2000(f)(4) of this subpart, specific location of the property within each accounting area in such manner that it can be readily spot-checked for proof of physical existence, the accounting company's number or designation, and any other description used in connection with the determination of the original cost. Descriptions of units of similar size and type shall follow prescribed groupings.</P>
                      <P>(6) <E T="03">Reinstalled units.</E> When units to which average costs are not applied, i.e., specific and fixed location units, are removed or retired and subsequently reinstalled, the date when the unit was first charged to the appropriate plant account shall, when required for adequate service life studies and reasonably accurate retirement accounting, be shown in addition to the date of reinstallation.</P>
                      <P>(7) <E T="03">Age and service life of property.</E> The continuing property record shall disclose the age of existing property and the supporting records shall disclose the service life of property retired. Exceptions from this requirement for any property record unit shall be submitted to the Commission for approval.</P>
                      <P>(8) <E T="03">Reference to sources of information.</E> There shall be shown by appropriate reference the source of all entries. All drawings, computations, and other detailed records which support quantities and costs or estimated costs shall be retained as a part of or in support of the continuing property record.</P>
                      <P>(9) <E T="03">Jointly owned property.</E> (i) With respect to jointly owned property, there shall be shown in the continuing property record or records supplemental thereto:</P>
                      <P>(A) The identity of all joint owners.</P>
                      <P>(B) The percentage owned by the accounting company.</P>
                      <P>(ii) When regulated plant is constructed under arrangements for joint ownership, the amount received by the constructing company from the other joint owner or owners shall be credited as a reduction of the gross cost of the plant in place.</P>
                      <P>(iii) When a sale of a part interest in regulated plant is made, the fractional interest sold shall be treated as a retirement and the amount received shall be treated as salvage. The continuing property record or records supplemental thereto shall be so maintained as to identify separately retirements of this nature from physical retirements of jointly owned plant.</P>
                      <P>(iv) If jointly owned regulated property is substantial in relation to the total of the same kind of regulated property owned wholly by the company, such jointly owned regulated property shall be appropriately segregated in the continuing property record.</P>
                      <P>(g) <E T="03">Depreciation accounting</E>—(1) <E T="03">Computation of depreciation rates.</E> (i) Unless otherwise provided by the Commission, either through prior approval or upon prescription by the Commission, depreciation percentage rates shall be computed in conformity with a group plan of accounting for depreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the property, except for losses excluded under the definition of depreciation, may be distributed under the straight-line method during the service life of the property.</P>

                      <P>(ii) In the event any composite percentage rate becomes no longer applicable, revised composite percentage rates shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="425"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(iii) The company shall keep such records of property and property retirements as will allow the determination of the service life of property which has been retired, or facilitate the determination of service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other appropriate methods. Such records will also allow the determination of the percentage of salvage value and cost of removal for property retired from each class of depreciable plant.</P>
                      <P>(2) <E T="03">Depreciation charges.</E> (i) A separate annual percentage rate for each depreciation category of telecommunications plant shall be used in computing depreciation charges.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Companies, upon receiving prior approval from this Commission, or, upon prescription by this Commission, shall apply such depreciation rate, except where provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section apply, as will ratably distribute on a straight line basis the difference between the net book cost of a class or subclass of plant and its estimated net salvage during the known or estimated remaining service life of the plant.</P>
                      <P>(iii) Charges for currently accruing depreciation shall be made monthly to the appropriate depreciation accounts, and corresponding credits shall be made to the appropriate depreciation reserve accounts. Current monthly charges shall normally be computed by the application of one-twelfth of the annual depreciation rate to the monthly average balance of the associated category of plant. The average monthly balance shall be computed using the balance as of the first and last days of the current month.</P>
                      <P>(iv) In certain circumstances and upon prior approval of this Commission, monthly charges may be determined in total or in part through the use of other methods whereby selected plant balances or portions thereof are ratably distributed over periods prescribed by this Commission. Such circumstances could include but not be limited to factors such as the existence of reserve deficiencies or surpluses, types of plant that will be completely retired in the near future, and changes in the accounting for plant. Where alternative methods have been used in accordance with this subparagraph, such amounts shall be applied separately or in combination with rates determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(3) <E T="03">Acquired depreciable plant.</E> When acquired depreciable plant carried in Account 1438, Deferred maintenance, retirements and other deferred charges, is distributed to the appropriate plant accounts, adjusting entries shall be made covering the depreciation charges applicable to such plant for the period during which it was carried in Account 1438.</P>
                      <P>(4) Plant Retired for Nonrecurring Factors not Recognized in Depreciation Rates.</P>
                      <P>(i) A retirement will be considered as nonrecurring (extraordinary) only if the following criteria are met:</P>
                      <P>(A) The impending retirement was not adequately considered in setting past depreciation rates.</P>
                      <P>(B) The charging of the retirement against the reserve will unduly deplete that reserve.</P>
                      <P>(C) The retirement is unusual such that similar retirements are not likely to recur in the future.</P>
                      <P>(5) Upon direction or approval from this Commission, the company shall credit Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, and charge Account 1438, Deferred Maintenance, retirements and other deferred charges, with the unprovided-for loss in service value. Such amounts shall be distributed from Account 1438 to Account 6561, Depreciation expense—Telecommunications plant in service, or Account 6562, Depreciation expense—property held for future telecommunications use, over such period as this Commission may direct or approve.</P>
                      <P>(h) <E T="03">Amortization accounting.</E> (1) Unless otherwise provided by this Commission, either through approval, or upon prescription by this Commission, amortization shall be computed on the straight-line method, i.e., equal annual amounts shall be applied. The cost of each type asset shall be amortized on the basis the estimated life of that asset and shall not be written off in the accounting period in which the asset is acquired. A reasonable estimate of the useful life may be based on the upper or lower limits even though a fixed existence is not determinable. However, <PRTPAGE P="426"/>the period of amortization shall not exceed forty years.</P>
                      <P>(2) In the event any estimated useful life becomes no longer applicable, a revised estimated useful life shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
                      <P>(3) Amortization charges shall be made monthly to the appropriate amortization expense accounts and corresponding credits shall be made to accounts 2005, 2682, 2690, and 3410, as appropriate. Monthly charges shall be computed by the application of one-twelfth to the annual amortization amount.</P>
                      <P>(4) The company shall keep such records as will allow the determination of the useful life of the asset.</P>

                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose of revenue accounts.</E> The revenue accounts are intended to include the actual cash inflows (or equivalents) that have or will occur as a result of the company's ongoing major or central operations during the period. They will include the revenues which arise from furnishing regulated telecommunications services to others, from directory advertising, rentals of telecommunications assets and from providing other services which are directly associated with the provision of regulated telecommunications services.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Deductions from revenue.</E> Corrections of overcharges, authorized refunds of overcollections previously credited to revenue, authorized refunds and adjustments on account of failure in service, and other corrections shall be charged to the revenue account previously credited with the amounts involved.</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Commissions.</E> Commissions paid to others or employees in place of compensation or salaries for services rendered, such as public telephone commissions, shall be charged to Account 6623, Customer services, and not to the revenue accounts. Other commissions shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Revenue recognition.</E> Credits shall be made to the appropriate revenue accounts when such revenue is actually earned. When the billing cycle encompasses more than one accounting period, adjustments are necessary to properly recognize the revenue applicable to the current accounting period under report. Revenues recorded under the terms of two-tier contracts or other variable payment plans should be deferred, if necessary, and recognized ratably with expenses over the terms of the related contract. Any amounts deferred shall be credited to Account 4300, Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Contractual arrangements.</E> Charges and credits resulting from activities associated with the provisions of regulated telecommunications services shall be recorded in a manner consistent with the nature of the underlying contractual arrangements. The charges and credits resulting from expense sharing or apportionment arrangements associated with the provision of regulated telecommunications services shall be recorded in the detailed regulated accounts. Charges and credits resulting from revenue settlement agreements or other revenue pooling arrangements associated with the provision of regulated telecommunications services shall be included in the appropriate revenue accounts. Those charges and credits resulting from contractual revenue pooling and/or sharing agreements shall be recorded in each prescribed revenue account and prescribed subsidiary record categories thereof to the extent that each is separately identifiable in the settlement process. It is not intended that settlement amounts be allocated or generally spread to the individual revenue accounts where they are not separately identifiable in the settlement process. When the settlement amounts are not identifiable by a revenue account they shall be recorded in Account 5060, Other basic area revenue, 5105, Long distance message revenue, or 5200, Miscellaneous revenue, as appropriate.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Subsidiary records—jurisdictional subdivisions and interconnection.</E> Subsidiary record categories shall be maintained in order that the company may separately report revenues derived from charges imposed under intrastate, interstate and international tariff filings. Class A carriers shall also maintain subsidiary record categories in order that the companies may separately report interconnection revenues derived from the following categories: Unbundled network element revenues, Resale revenues, Reciprocal compensation revenues, and Other interconnection revenues. Such subsidiary record categories shall be reported as required by part 43 of this Commission's Rules and Regulations.</P>
                      <P>(g) <E T="03">Structure of revenue accounts.</E> (1) The revenue section of the system of accounts shall be organized by revenue group summary account, account and subsidiary record category (if required).<PRTPAGE P="446"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(2) The revenue section of this system of accounts shall be comprised of six major groups—Local Network Services Revenues, Network Access Services Revenues, Long Distance Network Services Revenues, Miscellaneous Revenues, Nonregulated revenues, and Uncollectible Revenues, which shall be considered as a revenue group for the purposes of the construction of the system.</P>
                      <P>(3) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this Section subject to the conditions described in section 32.13 of subpart B. In certain instances, subsidiary record categories may be required below the account level by this system of accounts or by Commission order.</P>
                      <P>(h) <E T="03">Local Network Services revenues.</E> Local Network Services revenues (Accounts 5001 through 5060) shall include revenues derived from the provision of service and equipment entirely within the basic service area. That area is defined as the normal boundaries for local calling plus Extended Area Service (EAS) boundaries as they apply to that service. It includes revenues derived from both local private network service and local public network services as well as from customer premises facilities services. Local revenues include associated charges such as one-time service connection or termination charges and secondary features such as call waiting.</P>
                      <P>(i) <E T="03">Network Access revenues.</E> (1) Network Access revenues (Accounts 5081-5083) shall include revenues derived from the provision of exchange access services to an interexchange carrier or to an end user of telecommunications services beyond the exchange carrier's network.</P>
                      <P>(2) Billing and collections service provided under exchange access tariffs shall be included in the Miscellaneous Revenues Group.</P>
                      <P>(j) <E T="03">Long Distance Network Service revenues.</E> Long Distance Network Service revenues shall include revenues derived from the provision of services beyond the basic service area, whether message or flat-rate and including public network switching as well as private.</P>
                      <P>(k) <E T="03">Miscellaneous revenues.</E> Miscellaneous revenues are those revenues derived from the provision of regulated products and services provided under tariff or contract but not contained elsewhere. They shall also include operating revenue derived from activities performed incident to the company's tariffed telecommunications operations which, though non-tariffed, are included in the regulatory process.</P>
                      <P>(l) <E T="03">Nonregulated revenues.</E> The nonregulated revenue account shall be used for nonregulated operating revenues when a nonregulated activity involves the common or joint use of assets or resources in the provision of regulated and nonregulated products or services as required in § 32.23(c) of this subpart. Revenues from nontariffed activities offered incidental to tariffed services may be accounted for as regulated revenues, provided the activities are outgrowths of regulated operations and the revenues do not exceed, in the aggregate, one percent of total revenues for three consecutive years. Such activities must be listed in the Commission-approved Cost Allocation Manual for any company required to file a Cost Allocation Manual.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Long distance message revenue.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>This account shall include revenue derived from message services that terminate beyond the basic service area of the originating wire center and are individually priced. This includes those message services which utilize the public long distance switching network and the basic subscriber access line. It also includes those long distance calls placed from mobile and public telephones, as well as any charges for operator assistance or special billing directly related to the completion of a specific call. This account shall also include revenue derived from individually priced message services offered under calling plans (discounted long distance) which do not utilize dedicated access lines, as well as those priced at the basic long distance rates where a discounted toll charge is on a per message basis. Any revenue derived from monthly or one-time charges for obtaining calling plan services shall be included in this account. This account includes revenue derived from the following services:</P>
                      <P>(a) Long distance services which permit unidirectional calls to a subscriber from specified services areas (multipoint-to-point service). These calls require the use of dedicated access lines connecting a subscriber's premises and a designated central office. These dedicated access lines are generally separate from those required for the subscriber to place outward calls. The call is billed to the subscriber even though it is generally initiated by the subscriber's customer or correspondent.</P>

                      <P>(b) Long distance services which permit the subscriber to place telephone calls from one location to other specified service areas (point-to-multipoint service). These calls are completed without operator assistance and require the use of a dedicated access line. The dedicated access line is generally separate from those required for inward message services and cannot be used to place calls within the basic <PRTPAGE P="449"/>service area or calls outside the selected service areas. Outward calls are screened and blocked to determine whether the calls are within an authorized service area.</P>
                      <P>(c) Services extending beyond the basic service area that involve dedicated circuits, private switching arrangements, and/or predefined transmission paths, whether virtual or physical, which provide communications between specific locations (e.g., point-to-point communications). Service connection charges, termination charges, rearrangements and changes, etc., shall be included in this account. Revenue derived from associated administrative and operational support services shall also be included in this account.</P>
                      <P>(1) Narrow-band analog private network circuits and facilities furnished exclusively for record forms of communications, such as teletypewriter, teletypesetter, telewriter, ticker, Morse, signaling, remote metering, and supervisory services.</P>
                      <P>(2) Private network circuits and facilities (including multipurpose wide-band) which provide voice grade services for the transmission of analog signals. It includes revenue from services such as voice, data and telephoto communication, as well as remote metering, supervisory control, miscellaneous signaling and channels furnished for the purpose of extending customer—provided communications systems. It includes revenue from the provision of facilities between customer premises and a serving office, a carrier distribution point, or an extension distribution channel.</P>
                      <P>(3) Private network circuits and facilities furnished for audio program transmission purposes, such as radio broadcasting, sound recording (wired music) and loud speaker services. It includes revenue from the provision of facilities for the transmission of analog signals between customer premises and a serving office, a carrier distribution point, or an extension distribution channel furnished in connection with such services. It also includes revenue from facilities furnished to carry the audio portion of a television program if furnished under separate audio rates. If the rate for television program services includes both the picture and sound portion of the transmission, the revenue shall also be included in this account.</P>
                      <P>(4) Private network circuits and facilities furnished for television program transmission purposes, such as commercial broadcast and educational or private television services. It includes revenue from the provision of facilities for the transmission of analog signals between customer premises and a serving office, a carrier distribution point, or an extension distribution channel furnished in connection with such services. It also includes revenue from both the picture and sound portions of transmission for television program service when provided under a combined rate schedule.</P>
                      <P>(5) The provision of circuits and facilities for the transmission of digital signals only.</P>
                      <P>(6) The provision of common user channels and switching capabilities used for the transmission of telecommunication signals between three (3) or more points in the network. Also included is revenue derived from the provision of basic switching and transfer arrangements used to connect private line channels.</P>
                      <P>(7) Charges and credits resulting from contractual revenue pooling and/or sharing agreements for tariffed long distance public network services and for tariffed long distance private network services.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) <E T="03">Structure of the expense accounts.</E> (1) The expense section of the system of accounts shall be organized by expense group summary account, and subsidiary record category (if required).</P>
                      <P>(2) The expense section of this system of accounts shall be comprised of four major expense groups—Plant Specific Operations, Plant Nonspecific Operations, Customer Operations and Corporate Operations. Expenses to be recorded in Plant Specific and Plant Nonspecific Operations Expense Groups generally reflect cost associated with the various kinds of equipment identified in the plant asset accounts. Expenses to be recorded in the Customer Operations and Corporate Operations accounts reflect the costs of, or are associated with, functions performed by people, irrespective of the organization in which any particular function is performed.</P>
                      <P>(3) Accounts shall be maintained as prescribed in this section subject to the conditions described in § 32.13 in subpart B. Subsidiary record categories may be required below the account level by this system of accounts or by Commission order.</P>
                      <P>(b) <E T="03">Plant Specific Operations Expense.</E> (1) The Plant Specific Operations Expense Accounts, 6110 through 6441, are used to record costs related to specific kinds of telecommunications plant.</P>

                      <P>(2) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts predominantly mirror the telecommunications plant in service detail accounts and are numbered consistently with them; the first digit of the expense account being six (6) and the remaining digits being the same as <PRTPAGE P="452"/>the last three numbers of the related plant account. In classifying Plant Specific Operations expenses, the text of the corresponding plant account should be consulted to ensure appropriateness.</P>
                      <P>(3) The Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts shall include the costs of inspecting, testing (except as specified in Account 6533, Testing Expense) and reporting on the condition of telecommunications plant to determine the need for repairs, replacements, rearrangements and changes; performing routine work to prevent trouble (except as specified in Account 6533), replacing items of plant other than retirement units; rearranging and changing the location of plant not retired; repairing material for reuse; restoring the condition of plant damaged by storms, floods, fire or other casualties (other than the cost of replacing retirement units); inspecting after repairs have been made; and receiving training to perform these kinds of work. Also included are the costs of direct supervision (immediate of first-level) and office support of this work.</P>
                      <P>(4) In addition to the activities specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the appropriate Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts shall include the cost of personnel whose principal job is the operation of plant equipment, such as general purpose computer operators, aircraft pilots, chauffeurs and shuttle bus drivers. However, when the operation of equipment is performed as part of other identifiable functions (such as the use of office equipment, capital tools or motor vehicles), the operators' cost shall be charged to accounts appropriate for those functions. (For costs of operator services personnel, see Accounts 6621, Call completion services, and 6622, Number services, and for costs of test board personnel see Account 6533.)</P>
                      <P>(c) <E T="03">Plant nonspecific operations expense.</E> The Plant Nonspecific Operations Expense accounts shall include expenses related to property held for future telecommunications use, provisioning expenses, network operations expenses, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Accounts in this group (except for Account 6540, Access expense, and Accounts 6560 through 6565) shall include the costs of performing activities described in narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the costs of supervision and office support of these activities.</P>
                      <P>(d) <E T="03">Customer Operations Expense.</E> The Customer Operations Expense accounts shall include the cost of performing customer related marketing and services activities described in narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the costs of supervision, office support and training for these activities.</P>
                      <P>(e) <E T="03">Corporate Operations Expense.</E> The Corporate Operations Expense accounts shall include the costs of performing executive and planning activities and general and administrative activities described in narratives for individual accounts. These costs shall also include the costs of supervision, office support and training for these activities.</P>
                      <P>(f) <E T="03">Reimbursements.</E> Reimbursements of actual costs incurred in connection with joint operations or projects repairing plant due to damages by others, and obligations to make changes in telecommunications plant (such as highway relocations), shall be credited to the accounts originally charged.</P>
                      <P>(g) Expense accounts to be maintained.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) This part contains an outline of separations procedures for telecommunications companies on the station-to-station basis. These procedures are applicable either to property costs, revenues, expenses, taxes, and reserves as recorded on the books of the company or to estimated amounts.</P>
                      <P>(1) Where a value basis is used instead of book costs, the “costs” referred to are the “values” of the property derived from the valuation.</P>

                      <P>(b) The separations procedures set forth in this part are designed primarily for the allocation of property costs, revenues, expenses, taxes and reserves between state and interstate jurisdictions. For separations, where required, of the state portion between exchange and toll or for separations of individual exchanges or special services, further analyses and studies may be required to adapt the procedures to such additional separations.<PRTPAGE P="471"/>
                      </P>
                      <P>(c) The fundamental basis on which separations are made is the use of telecommunications plant in each of the operations. The first step is the assignment of the cost of the plant to categories. The basis for making this assignment is the identification of the plant assignable to each category and the determination of the cost of the plant so identified. The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the plant in each category among the operations by direct assignment where possible, and all remaining costs are assigned by the application of appropriate use factors.</P>
                      <P>(d) In assigning book costs to categories, the costs used for certain plant classes are average unit costs which equate to all book costs of a particular account or subaccount; for other plant classes, the costs used are those which either directly approximate book cost levels or which are equated to match total book costs at a given location.</P>
                      <P>(e) The procedures outlined herein reflect “short-cuts” where practicable and where their application produces substantially the same separations results as would be obtained by the use of more detailed procedures, and they assume the use of records generally maintained by Telecommunications Companies.</P>
                      <P>(f) The classification to accounts of telecommunications property, revenues, expenses, etc., set forth in this manual is that prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies.</P>
                      <P>(g) In the assignment of property costs to categories and in the apportionment of such costs among the operations, each amount so assigned and apportioned is identified as to the account classification in which the property is included. Thus, the separated results are identified by property accounts and apportionment bases are provided for those expenses which are separated on the basis of the apportionment of property costs. Similarly, amounts of revenues and expenses assigned each of the operations are identified as to account classification.</P>
                      <P>(h) The separations procedures described in this part are not to be interpreted as indicating what property, revenues, expenses and taxes, or what items carried in the income, reserve and retained earnings accounts, should or should not be considered in any investigation or rate proceeding.</P>

                      <SECTNO>§ 36.2</SECTNO>
                      <SUBJECT>Fundamental principles underlying procedures.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) The following general principles underlie the procedures outlined in this part:</P>
                      <P>(1) Separations are intended to apportion costs among categories or jurisdictions by actual use or by direct assignment.</P>
                      <P>(2) Separations are made on the “actual use” basis, which gives consideration to relative occupancy and relative time measurements.</P>
                      <P>(3) In the development of “actual use” measurements, measurements of use are (i) determined for telecommunications plant or for work performed by operating forces on a unit basis (e.g., conversation-minute-kilometers per message, weighted standard work seconds per call) in studies of traffic handled or work performed during a representative period for all traffic and (ii) applied to overall traffic volumes, i.e., 24-hour rather than busy-hour volumes.</P>
                      <P>(b) Underlying the procedures included in this manual for the separation of plant costs is an over-all concept which may be described as follows:</P>
                      <P>(1) Telecommunications plant, in general, is segregable into two broad classifications, namely, (i) interexchange plant, which is plant used primarily to furnish toll services, and (ii) exchange plant, which is plant used primarily to furnish local services.</P>
                      <P>(2) Within the interexchange classification, there are three broad types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, and trunk transmission equipment. Within the exchange classification there are four board types of plant, i.e., operator systems, switching plant, truck equipment and subscriber plant. Subscriber plant comprises lines to the subscriber.</P>
                      <P>(3) In general, the basis for apportioning telecommunications plant used jointly for state and interstate operations are:</P>

                      <P>(i) Operator work time expressed in weighted standard work seconds is the <PRTPAGE P="472"/>basis for measuring the use of operator systems.</P>
                      <P>(ii) Holding-time-minutes is the basis for measuring the use of local and toll switching plant.</P>
                      <P>(iii) Conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation minutes is the basis for measuring the use of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time minutes is the basis for measuring the use of exchange trunk plant. While the use of holding-time-minute-kilometers is the basic fundamental allocation factor for interexchange circuit plant and exchange trunk plant, the use of conversation-minute-kilometers or conversation-minutes for the allocation of interexchange circuit plant and holding-time minutes for the allocation of exchange trunk plant are considered practical approximations for separations between state and interstate operations when related to the broad types of plant classifications used herein.</P>
                      <P>(iv) Message telecommunications subscriber plant shall be apportioned on the basis of a Gross Allocator which assigns 25 percent to the interstate jurisdiction and 75 percent to the state jurisdiction.</P>
                      <P>(c) Property rented to affiliates, if not substantial in amount, is included as used property of the owning company with the associated revenues and expenses treated consistently: Also such property rented from affiliates is not included with the used property of the company making the separations; the rent paid is included in its expenses. If substantial in amount, the following treatment is applied:</P>
                      <P>(1) In the case of property rented to affiliates, the property and related expenses and rent revenues are excluded from the telephone operations of the owning company, and</P>
                      <P>(2) In the case of property rented from affiliates, the property and related expenses are included with, and the rent expenses are excluded from, the telephone operations of the company making the separation.</P>
                      <P>(d) Property rented to or from non-affiliates is usually to be included as used property of the owning company with the associated revenues and expenses treated consistently. In the event the amount is substantial, the property involved and the revenues and expenses associated therewith may be excluded from or included in the telecommunications operations of the company. When required, the cost of property rented to or from non-affiliates is determined using procedures that are consistent with the procedures for the allocation of costs among the operations.</P>
                      <P>(e) Costs associated with services or plant billed to another company which have once been separated under procedures consistent with general principles set forth in this part, and are thus identifiable as entirely interstate or State in nature, shall be directly assigned to the appropriate operation and jurisdiction.</P>

                      <SUBJECT>Freezing of jurisdictional separations category relationships and/or allocation factors.</SUBJECT>
                      <P>(a) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, all local exchange carriers subject to part 36 rules shall apportion costs to the jurisdictions using their study area and/or exchange specific jurisdictional allocation factors calculated during the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000, for each of the categories/sub-categories as specified herein. Direct assignment of private line service costs between jurisdictions shall be updated annually. Other direct assignment of investment, expenses, revenues or taxes between jurisdictions shall be updated annually. Local exchange carriers that invest in telecommunications plant categories during the period July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, for which it had no separations allocation factors for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000, shall apportion that investment among the jurisdictions in accordance with the separations procedures in effect as of December 31, 2000 for the duration of the freeze.</P>

                      <P>(b) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to § 61.41, shall assign costs from the part 32 accounts to the separations categories/sub-categories, as specified <PRTPAGE P="473"/>herein, based on the percentage relationships of the categorized/sub-categorized costs to their associated part 32 accounts for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000. If a part 32 account for separations purposes is categorized into more than one category, the percentage relationship among the categories shall be utilized as well. Local exchange carriers that invest in types of telecommunications plant during the period July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, for which it had no separations category investment for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000, shall assign such investment to separations categories in accordance with the separations procedures in effect as of December 31, 2000. Local exchange carriers not subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to § 61.41 of this chapter, may elect to be subject to the provisions of § 36.3(b). Such election must be made prior to July 1, 2001. Local exchange carriers electing to become subject to § 36.3(b) shall not be eligible to withdraw from such regulation for the duration of the freeze. Local exchange carriers participating in Association tariffs, pursuant to § 69.601 of this chapter et seq., shall notify the Association prior to July 1, 2001, of such intent to be subject to the provisions of § 36.3(b). Local exchange carriers not participating in Association tariffs shall notify the Commission prior to July 1, 2001, of such intent to be subject to the provisions of § 36.3(b).</P>
                      <P>(c) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, any local exchange carrier that sells or otherwise transfers exchanges, or parts thereof, to another carrier's study area shall continue to utilize the factors and, if applicable, category relationships as specified in §§ 36.3(a) and (b).</P>
                      <P>(d) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, any local exchange carrier that buys or otherwise acquires exchanges or part thereof, shall calculate new, composite factors and, if applicable, category relationships based on a weighted average of both the seller's and purchaser's factors and category relationships calculated pursuant to §§ 36.3(a) and 36.3(b). This weighted average should be based on the number of access lines currently being served by the acquiring carrier and the number of access lines in the acquired exchanges.</P>
                      <P>(1) To compute the composite allocation factors and, if applicable, the composite category percentage relationships of the acquiring company, the acquiring carrier shall first sum its existing (pre-purchase) access lines (A) with the total access lines acquired from selling company (B). Then, multiply its factors and category relationship percentages by (A/(A+B)) and those of the selling company by (B/(A+B)) and sum the results.</P>
                      <P>(2) For carriers subject to a freeze of category relationships, the acquiring carrier should remove all categories of investment from the selling carrier's list of frozen category relationships where no such category investment exists within the sold exchange(s). The seller's remaining category relationships must then be increased proportionately to total 100 percent. Then, the adjusted seller's category relationships must be combined with those of the acquiring carrier as specified in § 36.3(d)(1) to determine the category relationships for the acquiring carrier's post-transfer study area.</P>
                      <P>(e) Any local exchange carrier study area converting from average schedule company status, as defined in § 69.605(c) of this chapter, to cost company status during the period July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, shall, for the first twelve months subsequent to conversion categorize the telecommunications plant and expenses and develop separations allocation factors in accordance with the separations procedures in effect as of December 31, 2000. Effective July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2012, such companies shall utilize the separations allocation factors and account categorization subject to the requirements of §§ 36.3(a) and (b) based on the category relationships and allocation factors for the twelve months subsequent to the conversion to cost company status.</P>

                        <P>(b) Records of the cost of central office equipment are usually maintained for each study area separately by accounts. However, each account frequently includes equipment having more than one use. Also, equipment in one account frequently is associated closely with equipment in the same building in another account. Therefore, the separations procedures for central office equipment have been designed to deal with categories of plant rather than with equipment in an account.</P>
                        <P>(c) In the separation of the cost of central office equipment among the operations, the first step is the assignment of the equipment in each study area to categories. The basic method of making this assignment is the identification of the equipment assignable to each category, and the determination of the cost of the identified equipment by analysis of accounting, engineering and other records.</P>
                        <P>(1) The cost of common equipment not assigned to a specific category, e.g., common power equipment, including emergency power equipment, aisle lighting and framework, including distributing frames, is distributed among the categories in proportion to the cost of equipment, (excluding power equipment not dependent upon common power equipment) directly assigned to categories.</P>
                        <P>(i) The cost of power equipment used by one category is assigned directly to that category, e.g., 130 volt power supply provided for circuit equipment. The cost of emergency power equipment protecting only power equipment used by one category is also assigned directly to that category.</P>
                        <P>(ii) Where appropriate, a weighting factor is applied to the cost of circuit equipment in distributing the power plant costs not directly assigned, in order to reflect the generally greater power use per dollar of cost of this equipment.</P>
                        <P>(d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the equipment in each category among the operations through the application of appropriate use factors or by direct assignment.</P>

                        <P>(a) Cable and Wire Facilities, Account 2410, includes the following types of communications plant in service: Poles and antenna supporting structures, aerial cable, underground cable, buried cable, submarine cable, deep sea cable, intrabuilding network cable, aerial wire and conduit systems.</P>
                        <P>(b) For separations purposes, it is necessary to analyze the cable and wire facilities classified in subordinate records in order to determine their assignment to the categories listed in the following paragraphs.</P>
                        <P>(c) In the separation of the cost of cable and wire facilities among the operations, the first step is the assignment of the facilities to certain categories. The basic method of making this assignment is the identification of the facilities assignable to each category and the determination of the cost of the facilities so identified. Because of variations among companies in the character of the facilities and operating conditions, and in the accounting and engineering records maintained, the detailed methods followed, of necessity, will vary among the companies. The general principles to be followed, however, will be the same for all companies.</P>
                        <P>(d) The second step is the apportionment of the cost of the facilities in each category among the operations through the application of appropriate factors or by direct assignment.</P>

                        <P>(a) C&amp;WF are basically divided between exchange and interexchange. Exchange C&amp;WF consists of the following categories:</P>
                        <P>(1) Exchange Line C&amp;WF <E T="03">Excluding Wideband</E>—Category 1—This category includes C&amp;W facilities between local central offices and subscriber premises used for message telephone, private line, local channels, and for circuits between control terminals and radio stations providing very high frequency maritime service or urban or highway mobile service.</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Wideband and</E> Exchange Trunk C&amp;WF—Category 2—This category includes all wideband, including Exchange Line Wideband and C&amp;WF between local central offices and Wideband facilities. It also includes C&amp;WF between central offices or other switching points used by any common carrier for interlocal trunks wholly within an exchange or metropolitan service area, interlocal trunks with one or both terminals outside a metropolitan service area carrying some exchange traffic, toll connecting trunks, tandem trunks principally carrying exchange traffic, the exchange trunk portion of WATS access lines, the exchange trunk portion of private line local channels, and the exchange trunk portion of circuits between control terminals and radio stations providing very high frequency maritime service or urban or highway mobile service.</P>
                        <P>(3) The procedures for apportioning the cost of exchange cable and wire facilites among the operations are set forth in §§ 36.154 and 36.155.</P>

                        <P>(b) Interexchange C&amp;WF—Category 3—This category includes the C&amp;WF used for message toll and toll private line services. It includes cable and wire facilities carrying intertoll circuits, tributary circuits, the interexchange channel portion of special service circuits, circuits between control terminals and radio stations used for overseas or coastal harbor service, interlocal trunks between offices in the different exchange or metropolitan service areas carrying only message toll traffic and certain tandem trunks which carry principally message toll traffic.<PRTPAGE P="484"/>
                        </P>
                        <P>(1) The procedures for apportioning the cost of interexchange cable and wire facilities among the operations are set forth in § 36.156.</P>
                        <P>(c) Host/Remote Message C&amp;WF—Category 4—This category includes the cost of message host/remote location C&amp;WF for which a message circuit switching function is performed at the host central office. It applies to C&amp;WF between host offices and all remote locations. The procedures for apportioning the cost of these facilities among the operations are set forth in § 36.157.</P>
                        <P>(d) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, study areas subject to price cap regulation, pursuant to § 61.41, shall assign the average balance of Account 2410 to the categories/subcategories, as specified in §§ 36.152(a) through (c), based on the relative percentage assignment of the average balance of Account 2410 to these categories/subcategories during the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Assignment of Cable and Wire Facilities (C&amp;WF) to categories.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) Cable consists of: Aerial cable, underground cable, buried cable, submarine cable, deep sea cable and intrabuilding network cable. Where an entire cable or aerial wire is assignable to one category, its cost and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.</P>
                        <P>(1) <E T="03">Cable.</E> (i) There are two basic methods for assigning the cost of cable to the various categories. Both of them are on the basis of conductor cross section. The methods are as follows:</P>
                        <P>(A) By section of cable, uniform as to makeup and relative use by categories. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment records, determine in terms of equivalent gauge the number of pairs in use or reserved, for each category. The corresponding percentages of use, or reservation, are applied to the cost of the section of cable, i.e., sheath meters times unit cost per meter, to obtain the cost assignable to each category.</P>
                        <P>(B) By using equivalent pair kilometers, i.e., pair kilometers expressed in terms of equivalent gauge. From an analysis of cable engineering and assignment records, determine the equivalent pair kilometers in use for each category by type of facility, e.g., quadded, paired. The equivalent pair kilometers are then divided by a cable fill factor to obtain the equivalent pair kilometers in plant. The total equivalent pair kilometers in plant assigned to each category is summarized by type of facility, e.g., quadded and paired, and priced at appropriate average unit costs per equivalent pair kilometer in plant. If desired, this study may be made in terms of circuit kilometers rather than physical pair kilometers, with average cost and fill data consistent with the basis of the facilities kilometer count.</P>
                        <P>(ii) In the assignment of the cost of cable under the two basic methods described in § 36.153(a)(1)(i) consideration is given to the following:</P>
                        <P>(A) Method (A) described in § 36.153(a)(1)(i)(A) will probably be found more desirable where there is a relatively small amount of cable of variable make-up and use by categories. Conversely, method (B) described in § 36.153(a)(1)(i)(B) will probably be more desirable where there is a large amount of cable of variable make-up and use by categories. However, in some cases a combination of both methods may be desirable.</P>
                        <P>(B) It will be desirable in some cases to determine the amount assignable to a particular category by deducting from the total the sum of the amounts assigned to all other categories.</P>
                        <P>(C) For use in the assignment of poles to categories, the equivalent sheath kilometers of aerial cable assigned to each category are determined. For convenience, these quantities are determined in connection with assignment of cable costs.</P>
                        <P>(D) Where an entire cable is assignable to one category, its costs and quantity are, where practicable, directly assigned.</P>

                        <P>(iii) For cables especially arranged for high-frequency transmission such as shielded, disc-insulated and coaxial, recognition is given to the additional <PRTPAGE P="485"/>costs which are charged to the high-frequency complement.</P>
                        <P>(2) <E T="03">Cable Loading.</E> (i) Methods for assigning the cost of loading coils, cases, etc., to categories are comparable with those used in assigning the associated cable to categories. Loading associated with cable which is directly assigned to a given category is also directly assigned. The remaining loading is assigned to categories in either of the following bases:</P>
                        <P>(A) By an analysis of the use made of the loading facilities where a loading coil case includes coils assignable to more than one category, e.g., in the case of a single gauge uniformly loaded section, the percentage used in the related cable assignment are applicable, or</P>
                        <P>(B) By pricing out each category by determining the pair meters of loaded pairs assigned to each category and multiplying by the unit cost per pair meter of loading by type.</P>
                        <P>(3) <E T="03">Other Cable Plant.</E> (i) In view of the small amounts involved, the cost of all protected terminals and gas pressure contactor terminals in the toll cable subaccounts is assigned to the appropriate Interexchange Cable &amp; Wire Facilities categories. The cost of all other terminals in the exchange and toll cable subaccounts is assigned to Exchange Cable and Wire Facilities.</P>
                        <P>(b) <E T="03">Aerial Wire.</E> (1) The cost of wire accounted for as exchange is assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable &amp; Wire Facilities categories. The cost of wire accounted for as toll, which is used for exchange, is also assigned to the appropriate Exchange Cable &amp; Wire Facilities categories. The cost of the remaining wire accounted for as toll is assigned to the appropriate Interexchange Cable &amp; Wire Facilities categories as described in § 36.156. For companies not maintaining exchange and toll subaccounts, it is necessary to review the plant records and identify wire plant by use. The cost of wire used for providing circuits directly assignable to a category is assigned to that category. The cost of wire used for providing circuit facilities jointly used for exchange and interexchange lines is assigned to categories on the basis of the relative number of circuit kilometers involved.</P>
                        <P>(c) <E T="03">Poles and Antenna Supporting Structures.</E> (1) In the assignment of these costs, anchors, guys, crossarms, antenna supporting structure, and right-of-way are included with the poles.</P>
                        <P>(2) Poles. (i) The cost of poles is assigned to categories based on the ratio of the cost of poles to the total cost of aerial wire and aerial cable.</P>
                        <P>(d) <E T="03">Conduit Systems.</E> (1) The cost of conduit systems is assigned to categories on the basis of the assignment of the cost of underground cable.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Equal access equipment.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) Equal access investment includes only initial incremental expenditures for hardware and other equipment related directly to the provision of equal access which would not be required to upgrade the capabilities of the office involved absent the provision of equal access. Equal access investment is limited to such expenditures for converting central offices which serve competitive interexchange carriers or where there has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal access.</P>
                        <P>(b) Equal access investment is first segregated from all other amounts in the primary accounts.</P>

                        <P>(c) The equal access investment determined in this manner is allocated between the jurisdictions on the basis of relative state and interstate equal access traffic including interstate interLATA equal access traffic, intrastate interLATA equal access traffic, and BOC interstate corridor toll traffic <PRTPAGE P="488"/>as well as AT&amp;T and OCC intraLATA equal access usage. Local exchange traffic and BOC intraLATA toll traffic is excluded. In the case of independent telephone companies, intrastate toll service provided by the independent local exchange company is excluded in determining intrastate usage, but intrastate toll service provided by long distance carriers affiliated with the local exchange company is included.</P>
                        <P>(d) Effective July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012, all study areas shall apportion Equal Access Equipment, as specified in § 36.191(a), among the jurisdictions using the relative state and interstate equal access traffic, as specified in § 36.191(c), for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2000.</P>

                        <SUBJECT>Apportionment procedures.</SUBJECT>
                        <P>(a) For apportionment purposes, the expenses in this account are segregated into two groups as follows: (1) Operating Federal, State and local income taxes and (2) all other operating taxes.</P>
                        <P>(b) Operating Federal, State and local income taxes are apportioned among the operations on the basis of the approximate net taxable income (positive or negative) applicable to each of the operations. The approximate net taxable income from each of the operations is the summation of the following amounts apportioned to each operation by means of the procedures set forth in this Manual:</P>
                        <P>(1) Operating revenues,</P>
                        <P>(2) Less operating expenses,</P>
                        <P>(3) Less operating taxes except the net income tax being apportioned and except any other tax not treated as a deductible item in the determination of taxable net income for this purpose.</P>
                        <P>(4) Less operating fixed charges.</P>
                        <P>(i) The amount of fixed charges attributable to the operations is obtained by subtracting the tax component (positive or negative) attributable to other than the operating fixed charges, i.e., fixed charges on non-operating investments are that proportion of total fixed charges which non-operating net investments are of total operating and non-operating net investments.</P>
                        <P>(ii) Operating fixed charges including interest on Rural Telephone Bank Stock are apportioned among the operations on the basis of the separation of the cost of telephone plant less appropriate reserves.</P>
                        <P>(c) Other operating taxes should be directly assigned to the appropriate jurisdiction where possible, e.g., Local Gross Receipts may be directly identified as applicable to one jurisdiction. Where direct assignment is not feasible, these expenses should be apportioned among the operations on the basis of the separation of the cost of Telecommunications Plant in Service—Account 2001.</P>

Equal access expenses are limited to such expenditures for converting central offices that serve competitive interexchange carriers or where there <PRTPAGE P="501"/>has been a bona fide request for conversion to equal access.</P>
                        <P>(b) Equal access expenses are apportioned between the jurisdictions by first segregating them from all other expenses in the primary accounts and then allocating them on the same basis as equal access investment.</P>

                        <P>(a) The term Universal Service Fund in this subpart refers only to the support for loop-related costs included in § 36.621. The term Universal Service in part 54 of this chapter refers to the comprehensive discussion of the Commission's rules implementing section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 254, which addresses universal service support for rural, insular, and high cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and heath care providers. The expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall be added to interstate expenses and deducted from state expenses after expenses and taxes have been apportioned pursuant to subpart D of this part. Beginning January 1, 1998, the expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart will be administered and funded through <PRTPAGE P="502"/>the new universal service system discussed in part 54 of this chapter.</P>
                        <P>(b) The expense adjustment will be computed on the basis of data for a preceding calendar year which may be updated at the option of the carrier pursuant to § 36.612(a).</P>
                        <P>(c) Until June 30, 2001, the annual amount of the total nationwide expense adjustment shall consist of the amounts calculated pursuant to § 54.309 of this chapter and the amounts calculated pursuant to this subpart F. The annual amount of the total nationwide loop cost expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not exceed the amount of the total loop cost expense adjustment for the immediately preceding calendar year, increased by a rate equal to the rate of increase in the total number of working loops during the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing. The total loop cost expense adjustment shall consist of the loop cost expense adjustments, including amounts calculated pursuant to § 36.612(a) and § 36.631. The rate of increase in total working loops shall be based upon the difference between the number of total working loops on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing and the number of total working loops on December 31 of the second calendar year preceding that filing, both determined by the company's submissions pursuant to § 36.611. Beginning January 1, 2000, non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers and, eligible telecommunications carriers serving lines in the service area of non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers, shall only receive support pursuant to this subpart F to the extent that they qualify pursuant to § 54.311 of this chapter for interim hold-harmless support. Support amounts calculated pursuant to this subpart F but not received due to the phase down of interim hold-harmless support or the receipt of forward-looking support pursuant to § 54.311 of this chapter shall not be redistributed to other carriers.</P>

        <SUBJECT>OMB control numbers and expiration dates assigned pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</SUBJECT>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section displays the control numbers and expiration dates for the Commission information collection requirements assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13. The Commission intends that this section comply with the requirement that agencies “display” current control numbers and expiration dates assigned by the Director, OMB, for each approved information collection requirement. Not withstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) that does not display a currently valid OMB control number. Questions concerning the OMB control numbers and expiration dates should be directed to the Associate Managing Director—Performance Evaluation and Records Management, (“AMD-PERM”), Office of Managing Director, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554 by sending an e-mail to <E T="03">Judith-B.Herman@fcc.gov</E>.</P>
